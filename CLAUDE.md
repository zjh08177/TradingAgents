# Claude Code Configuration - SPARC Development Environment (Batchtools Optimized)

## Principles of Execution

### 1. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Encourages writing straightforward, uncomplicated solutions
- Avoids over-engineering and unnecessary complexity
- Results in more readable and maintainable code

### 2. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Prevents adding speculative features
- Focuses on implementing only what's currently needed
- Reduces code bloat and maintenance overhead

### 3. SOLID Principles
#### 3.1 Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change

#### 3.2 Open-Closed Principle
- Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification

#### 3.3 Liskov Substitution Principle
- Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program

#### 3.4 Interface Segregation Principle
- Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

#### 3.5 Dependency Inversion Principle
- Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

### 4. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Repeating code is an invitation to problems
- Keep logic in one place to avoid errors and facilitate maintenance
- Ensures consistency across the codebase
