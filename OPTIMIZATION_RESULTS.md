# TradingAgents Optimization Results

## Summary of Cleanup Actions

### Phase 1: Immediate Wins (Completed)
1. **Removed duplicate root .venv**: Saved 673MB
2. **Removed Flutter build artifacts**: Saved 395MB  
3. **Cleaned LangGraph checkpoints**: Saved 50MB
4. **Cleaned Swarm databases**: Saved 18MB
5. **Cleaned old CSV cache files**: Saved 7MB

**Total Phase 1 Savings: 1.14GB**

### Current Status
- **Initial Size**: 2.2GB
- **Current Size**: 1.6GB
- **Reduction**: 600MB (27% reduction)

### Phase 2: Virtual Environment Optimization (Pending)
To achieve the target <500MB, you need to:

1. **Recreate Backend .venv** with minimal requirements:
   - Current: 626MB with 251 packages
   - Target: ~150MB with essential packages only
   - Potential savings: 476MB

2. **Recreate Trading-graph-server .venv**:
   - Current: 274MB with 102 packages  
   - Target: ~100MB with essential packages only
   - Potential savings: 174MB

### Identified Unused Heavy Packages
- **onnxruntime**: 120MB (not imported anywhere)
- **chromadb**: 43MB (only used in memory.py - consider alternatives)
- **py_mini_racer**: 38MB (not imported anywhere)
- **chainlit**: 28MB (frontend framework not needed for backend)

### Next Steps
1. Run `CLEANUP_PHASE2.sh` to create minimal virtual environments
2. Test all functionality with minimal dependencies
3. Remove backup virtual environments after validation
4. Consider Docker-based deployment to avoid local venv bloat

### Final Expected Results
- **Target Size**: <500MB
- **Expected Final Reduction**: 77% (from 2.2GB to ~500MB)
- **Performance Impact**: Faster installs, CI/CD, and development

## Key Findings
1. **Virtual environments are the biggest culprit** (1.57GB of 2.2GB)
2. **Many installed packages are never imported** in the codebase
3. **Hidden directories** (.langgraph_api, .swarm) accumulate significant data
4. **Build artifacts** should be gitignored and cleaned regularly

## Recommendations
1. Use `requirements_minimal.txt` for production
2. Create separate `requirements-dev.txt` for development tools
3. Implement regular cleanup scripts in CI/CD
4. Consider using Docker to standardize environments
5. Add comprehensive .gitignore entries for all build/cache directories
