After considering the investment plan for AAPL, there are several compelling reasons to move forward with a buy recommendation.

1. **Earnings Growth Potential**: Despite potential market saturation concerns with the iPhone, Apple's robust services segment and potential rebounds in other areas (e.g., India, China) are set to drive ~20% EPS growth in the next fiscal year.

2. **Financial Strength**: With a substantial net-cash position and significant free cash flow, Apple has the flexibility to engage in share buybacks, increase dividends, and continue investing in emerging technologies such as AI and AR.

3. **Ecosystem Advantages**: Apple's installed base of 2 billion devices represents a solid moat and supports ongoing high-margin services revenue growth. This is crucial for sustaining long-term profitability, especially during hardware revenue soft spots.

4. **Improved Valuation Outlook**: Apple's forward P/E ratio suggests a potential for multiple expansions, which may enhance future stock price appreciation, especially if growth rates accelerate from current levels.

5. **Technical Tailwinds**: The recent positive momentum, evidenced by a bullish MACD crossover, supports a strengthened risk/reward profile. Despite technical caution due to overbought RSI signals, the overall technical backdrop looks promising.

6. **Mitigating Key Risks**: While concerns about iPhone saturation, supply chain issues, and potential legal risks exist, these are longstanding challenges that Apple has successfully navigated in the past. The company's evolving and diversified revenue streams help mitigate these risks.

Learning from past lessons, I am focusing on data-driven arguments and forthcoming catalysts, such as the anticipated AI initiatives and India manufacturing capability expansion, rather than defaulting to a Hold stance due to the persuasive nature of opposing arguments. Further, I've continued improving risk management strategies, including stop-loss measures and protective hedging.

**Actionable Strategies**: 
- Initiate a starter position of 2% as part of the portfolio today.
- Utilize the suggested 0.75-delta put spread as protective hedging around significant event risks.
- Keep a close watch on upcoming catalysts, especially Apple's AI announcements and India ramp-up, for additional position adjustments.

Given the comprehensive analysis and strategic safeguards outlined, I recommend proceeding with the buy recommendation for AAPL.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
