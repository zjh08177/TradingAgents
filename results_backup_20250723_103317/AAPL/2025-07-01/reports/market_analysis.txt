### Market Analysis of AAPL (June 30, 2024 - July 1, 2025)

#### Price Trend and Market Context:
The historical price data reveals a period of sustained volatility with notable price swings. The stock experienced strong upward momentum from mid-2024, peaking around early October 2024, before entering a correction phase starting late 2024 into 2025. The lows in April 2025 and subsequent rebounds suggest a market oscillating between bullish corrections and consolidations.

#### Moving Averages:
- **50 SMA**: Recently around 202.75 (June 30, 2025), the 50 SMA has remained relatively flat, indicating a stabilization in the medium-term trend. Notably, the current close (~205.17) has been consistently hovering above or around this level, which suggests the short-term trend may have regained upward momentum.
- **200 SMA**: Approximately 222.83 (June 30, 2025), significantly above current prices, indicating that the long-term trend remains bearish or sideways. The current price being below the 200 SMA suggests that the overall long-term trend has not yet fully turned bullish.

#### Momentum:
- **MACD**: The recent MACD values around -0.295 suggest a mild positive shift from the previous more negative readings (~ -1.68 to -1.39 in late June 2024). The MACD has historically oscillated between negative and less negative values, indicating periods of momentum loss and potential recovery. A rising MACD histogram, if confirmed, may signal waning selling pressure.

#### Summary of Trends:
- The price remains below the long-term 200 SMA, indicating that the longer-term market environment is still cautious, possibly bearish.
- The price is now closer to the 50 SMA, which could act as a near-term support level.
- The MACD's recent upward movement and less negative readings lean towards diminishing downside momentum, hinting at potential consolidation or a reversal.

### Key Insights:
- The breach of the 200 SMA and sustained below it maintain a cautious or bearish overall outlook.
- The proximity of the current price to the 50 SMA suggests that this level may serve as an immediate support zone.
- Momentum indicators point towards a potential shift from strong downside movement to a more neutral or mildly bullish phase, but are not yet signaling a clear breakout or uptrend.

### Recommendations:
- For long-term investors, patience is advised until the price convincingly breaks above the 200 SMA.
- Short-term traders might watch for the 50 SMA as a support level and look for confirmation from momentum indicators like MACD for signs of trend reversal.
