It seems there is a technical issue preventing the retrieval of the latest fundamental data for AAPL using the current tools. 

Given this limitation, I can provide a general analysis based on historical knowledge up to October 2023 and typical fundamental factors considered for a company like Apple Inc. 

Would you like me to proceed with a general fundamental analysis based on historical data and industry context, or do you have other specific questions about Apple?
