Based on the comprehensive plan and insights provided, the recommendation is clear. Despite the initial allure of CAI's potential in the precision-oncology market and its hot IPO start, the lack of transparency in financials poses a significant risk. Past experiences have shown that investments made without sufficient financial data tend to lead to unfavorable results. The current technical indicators and competitive landscape further underline the bearish perspective.

Given these observations and the robust rationale outlined for why opacity in financials is a deal-breaker, the safest course of action is to sell any existing positions or avoid initiating one altogether until substantial financial disclosures are released. This proactive stance aligns with controlling asymmetric tail risks and ensuring investment decisions are data-backed rather than speculative.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
