## Global Economic Overview

### U.S. Dollar and Federal Reserve Developments
The U.S. dollar has experienced a significant decline, falling by over 10% year-to-date, reaching its worst first-half performance since 1973. This decline is fueled by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and political uncertainty concerning Fed leadership. President Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, coupled with speculations of a possible replacement, has heightened concerns about the independence of the central bank, introducing significant market volatility. The weakening of the dollar has allowed other currencies like the euro, Swiss franc, and British pound to appreciate. This context has contributed to increased global economic uncertainty and currency market volatility.

### Global Stock Market Rally
Recent weeks have witnessed a rally in global stock markets, with U.S. indices such as the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite achieving gains due to investor optimism regarding potential U.S. interest rate cuts and a weak dollar. Technology stocks, in particular, have thrived under these circumstances. These movements suggest a favorable environment for equity investments, especially in the tech sector, although cautious optimism should be maintained given the current uncertainties.

### Gold Prices and Middle East Tensions
Gold prices have surged to a record $3,500 per ounce, reflecting heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid dollar weaknesses and geopolitical uncertainty, particularly tensions in the Middle East. Despite escalating threats from Iran concerning the Strait of Hormuz closure and conflicts with Israel, a ceasefire has brought some stability, slightly easing oil price pressures.

### NATO Summit and Defense Spending
NATO's recent summit concluded with member states agreeing to elevate defense spending to 5% of GDP. This decision is bound to impact defense-related sectors and national budgets. Investors may consider opportunities in defense stocks, although geopolitical tensions remain a potential risk factor.

### Philippines Economic Forecast
The Philippines has revised its 2025 economic growth forecast downward to 5.5%-6.5%, reflecting a more cautious outlook amid global uncertainties such as Middle East tensions and fluctuations in U.S. trade policies. Reduced inflation rates are anticipated in this revised forecast, highlighting the interconnectedness of global economic and geopolitical factors.
