Recommendation:  SELL  

================================================================
Why SELL is the clearest, least-regret decision
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. “The company lost $297 million in one quarter and has no clear line of sight to break-even.”  (Safe & original bear case)  
   • Losses are widening, not narrowing, so the primary catalyst for a re-rating (turn toward profitability) is absent.  
2. “Valuation is very rich – price-to-sales 29×, which leaves little margin for error.”  (Bear case)  
   • Even if the 45 % CAGR materialises, a 29× P/S multiple already embeds heroic success.  
3. Technicals confirm the fundamentals: “share price cut in half in a month, trades below the 50- and 200-day moving averages.”  
   • Persistent distribution signals institutional selling; probability of another leg down is high.  
4. The only near-term bullish supports—Golden Dragon Index inclusion and rumored Uber deal—are “still speculative; inclusion in an index is not a moat.”  (Safe)  
   • No binding contract, no revenue. Optionality exists, but is not investable today.  
5. Lessons from past errors in high-growth, loss-making names (e.g., 2021 EV bubble) show that waiting for “proof points” beats buying hope.  

The Neutral analyst’s “partial divestment” still admits the risk is skewed left; it simply fears missing out. FOMO is not a thesis. The Risky analyst provides upside scenarios but no hard trigger, and upside can be re-entered once facts change.

Updated Trader’s Plan (builds on the original, tightens execution)
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Position action  
   • Exit 100 % of the equity position within the next three trading days (rather than five) while liquidity is still reasonable.  
   • Replace up-to-10 % of the notional exposure with January $10 call options (cheap “lottery ticket”) if you need mental exposure; risk is capped.  

2. Order mechanics  
   • Use VWAP-anchored algo or three equal tranches during the first 90 minutes of each session; target price ≤ 1 % below prevailing bid.  
   • Halt selling only if a 10 %+ intraday spike is accompanied by a company 8-K (hard news). Otherwise keep to schedule.  

3. Re-entry criteria (must meet ALL)  
   • Two consecutive quarters of ≥ 30 % revenue growth AND cash burn < $50 million/quarter.  
   • A signed commercial contract that generates at least $50 million annual run-rate revenue.  
   • Valuation falls to P/S ≤ 10 OR EV/Revenue ≤ 8.  
   • 50-dma crosses above the 200-dma on ≥ 125 % of average volume (technical confirmation).  

4. Risk-management lessons applied  
   • 2022-23 losses in SNOW, RIVN teach that valuation compression can persist even while revenue grows. Do not average down.  
   • Using options for upside keeps capital available for higher-conviction names while preserving optionality.  
   • A written, quantitative checklist prevents headline-driven whipsaws.

Bottom line
----------------------------------------------------------------
All three analysts acknowledge extreme uncertainty; only the Risky analyst argues for immediate upside, and that argument is largely aspirational. The cash-burn/valuation/technical triad is objectively negative, and history shows that ignoring those signals is costly. Therefore, the disciplined and capital-preserving move is to SELL now, crystalise any tax benefit, and revisit only after the company proves it can convert promise into profit.
