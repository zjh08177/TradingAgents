Here’s how I see the debate once the rhetoric is stripped away.

Key bullish points  
• Revenue is growing fast (management guides to ~45 % CAGR) and the company still sits on a large cash pile – current ratio 11.7, no debt.  
• Being added to the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index and rumored talks with Uber give the story some credibility and optionality.  
• Autonomous-vehicle TAM is huge; early losses are normal for a disruptive tech play.

Key bearish points  
• The company lost $297 million in one quarter and has no clear line of sight to break-even.  
• Valuation is very rich – price-to-sales 29×, which leaves little margin for error.  
• Stock action is ugly: share price cut in half in a month, trades below the 50- and 200-day moving averages, RSI < 50.  
• Competition is brutal (Tesla, Waymo, Cruise). Pony lacks scale and regulatory advantage.  
• Any partnership talk is still speculative; inclusion in an index is not a moat.

My verdict – Sell (close or avoid a long position)  
The bear case attacks fundamentals (large and widening losses), valuation (bubble-level P/S) and technicals (persistent downtrend). The bull case mainly rests on a big TAM, cash on hand, and hopes for future partnerships. Cash is nice, but cash burns quickly at a $1-billion-plus annualized loss rate, and a rich valuation means the market already prices in much of the dream. Risk-reward skews negative.

Detailed investment plan

1. What to do  
   • If you hold the stock: exit the position over the next five trading days. Use limit orders to manage liquidity; target an average price no worse than 1 % below prevailing bid.  
   • If you do not hold it: keep it off the buy list until either (a) the company produces two consecutive quarters of sharply narrowing losses and wins a flagship commercial contract, or (b) the valuation falls below 10× sales.

2. Why I’m doing it  
   • Preserve capital: past mistakes have shown me that staying too long in richly valued, loss-making “story” stocks can erase gains quickly.  
   • Opportunity cost: cash freed today can be redeployed into profitable names that are also exposed to AI but carry sane multiples.  
   • Defined re-entry criteria keep me open to the upside without tying up capital meanwhile.

3. Trade mechanics  
   • Lot sizes: Sell in three equal tranches on successive days to reduce market impact.  
   • Stops: If the stock suddenly spikes 10 % intraday on real news (signed OEM deal, confirmed Uber stake, regulatory milestone), pause the selling to reassess.  
   • Tax awareness: Realize any losses this calendar year to offset gains elsewhere; document cost basis.

4. Monitoring checklist for potential future buy  
   • Quarterly cash burn < $50 million.  
   • Commercial fleet deployment > 1,000 vehicles with paying riders.  
   • P/S ratio < 10 or EV/Revenue < 8.  
   • 50-day moving average crosses above 200-day (technical confirmation).

Until at least two of those boxes are ticked, the prudent move is to stay on the sidelines. In short: protect the downside now, leave the door open for a better-priced, better-proven Pony AI later.
