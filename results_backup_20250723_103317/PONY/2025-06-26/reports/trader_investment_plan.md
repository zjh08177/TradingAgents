Based on your provided investment plan for PONY, I align with your detailed analysis and strategy that centers around mitigating risk and capital preservation. The outlined bearish factors—specifically the high cash burn rate, lack of profitability, and tough competition—highlight significant downside risks that outweigh the potential upside at this time. Past experiences with similar richly-valued "story" stocks have taught us the importance of exiting positions to avoid quick erosion of gains, driven by market corrections due to speculative valuations.

The proposed plan emphasizes capital flexibility while maintaining a disciplined approach to potentially re-enter at favorable conditions, which is a wise strategy given the volatile tech space. Additionally, the use of limit orders, strategic selling in tranches, and specific re-entry criteria demonstrate thoughtful risk management and an adaptable mindset.

Considering all of the above, the recommendation is to follow through with the advised selling strategy. This decision is based on a combination of current negative technical signals, unattractive financial metrics, and the opportunity to redeploy capital more effectively elsewhere.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
