### Global Macroeconomic Developments

1. **Middle East Conflict**:

   - This deal has led to positive market sentiment, with major indices like the S&P 500 seeing gains.

3. **Wall Street Trends**:
   - Driven by AI-related excitement, weakened dollar, and potential interest rate cuts, U.S. equities are reaching near record highs. Major stocks like Micron and Nvidia are showing significant strength.

4. **China's Economic Policy**:
   - Chinaâ€™s central bank plans to expedite its policy response to both domestic and international challenges with potential rate cuts anticipated in the near future.

5. **NATO Summit**:
   - Members committed to increasing defense spending, which may impact defense-related stocks positively.

6. **Global Trade Outlook**:
   - Rising tendencies for tariffs, especially impacting automotive supply chains, are threatening global trade growth, leading to revised lower growth forecasts by leading economic organizations.
