Recommendation: BUY (build it deliberately, hedge it intelligently)

1. Key Arguments Distilled  
Risky (Pro-Buy)  
• “Alignment above the long-term moving averages…signals ongoing bullish sentiment.”  
• “2024e FCF > $60 bn and a still-net-cash balance sheet let Meta fund AI without strain.”  
• “Llama models are already live, driving higher engagement and incremental ad inventory.”  

Safe (Pro-Hold/Sell)  
• “MACD rollover and flattening RSI…are potential shifts in investor sentiment.”  
• “Wrongful-death suit and DMA scrutiny introduce a layer of unpredictability.”  
• “$26 bn of new private-credit debt could pinch if rates rise or AI ROI disappoints.”  

Neutral (Middle Ground)  
• “AI investment merits participation, but phased entry and vigilance on legal front are prudent.”  
• “Meta’s past regulatory resilience matters, yet short-term momentum cooling can’t be ignored.”  

2. Why BUY Wins (with safeguards)  
Fundamentals trump timing: cash-flow dominance, a 3.2 bn-user data moat, and AI already in production present a tangible growth engine. The bear case leans on “what-if” legal hits and near-term chart signals—risks worth hedging, not reasons to forfeit ownership.  
Debt still modest: even after the $26 bn raise, Meta remains in a net-cash position; interest coverage >40×.  
Regulatory history: fines have historically clipped valuation 5-10 % temporarily but never impaired the core ad engine. Cash flow gives Meta room to settle or litigate.  
Technical cooling is acknowledged: staging the entry and adding optional puts directly addresses the Safe Analyst’s concerns.  

3. Refined Trader Plan (starting from original)  
Target Weight & Phasing (unchanged)  
• 4 % of equity portfolio, but tranche timing tweaked:  
  – Tranche 1: 30 % today (not 40 %) to acknowledge momentum fade.  
  – Tranche 2: 35 % at the 50-day SMA OR post-earnings gap-down ≥5 %.  
  – Tranche 3: 35 % at the 200-day SMA OR if MACD turns decisively upward—whichever first.  
If neither level is hit within six weeks and price breaks to a new high on >1.5 × average volume, complete the position then (prevents indefinite under-exposure).  

Hedge & Risk Controls (beefed up per Safe Analyst)  
• Protective puts: raise coverage to ~50 % of the position, 3–6-month tenor, 10-15 % OTM; budget ≤0.6 % of portfolio annually.  
• Event-driven stop: cut the whole position if (a) EU/DMA fines exceed $10 bn AND (b) YoY Family-of-Apps revenue growth <10 %.  
• Credit watch: if net cash turns negative OR interest-expense/FCF >10 %, trim to 1 %.  

Review Metrics (added)  
• Monthly: RSI/MACD divergence to catch trend breaks early.  
• Quarterly: AI ad-revenue contribution %, capex/FCF, and head-count growth in Meta AI division.  

Upside Targets (unchanged)  
Base $560, Bull $650. Add a trailing stop: after a 30 % gain, raise the soft stop to the 100-day SMA to protect profits.  

4. Lesson Applied  
Past paralysis (“defaulting to Hold”) cost upside in NVDA 2023. This time the call is decisive—BUY—but the position size, phased entry, and expanded hedges directly incorporate the Safe Analyst’s warnings so we capture long-term upside while insulating against near-term technical or legal shocks.
