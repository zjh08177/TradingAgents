1. **50 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**:
   - Current Value: 623.69 (as of 2025-06-25)
   - Analysis: The 50 SMA is indicating a medium-term upward trend as the value has been progressively increasing from 582.26 to 623.69 over the period. This can be interpreted as medium-term strengthening in the market sentiment toward META.

Overall, META is currently in a bullish phase with indicators aligning to reflect positive momentum. However, close attention must be paid to potential overbought conditions as indicated by RSI nearing 70 and Bollinger Bands. Traders considering entries might want to await pullbacks or solid confirmations beyond key resistance levels. On the other hand, current holders could benefit from sustained positions unless sharp volume-driven reversals or bearish signals appear.

If any further detailed actionable insights or additional analysis on specific strategies are required, this could involve examining signal divergences or more precise risk assessments based on support/resistance levels.
