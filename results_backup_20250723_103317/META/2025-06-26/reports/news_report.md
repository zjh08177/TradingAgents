### Global Macroeconomic Context

1. **U.S. Dollar Decline and Speculation on Federal Reserve Actions:**
   - The U.S. dollar has seen a 10% decline year-to-date, marking its worst performance in the first half since 1973. This drop is influenced by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and political uncertainty surrounding the leadership of the Fed. President Trump's criticism of the Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the hints of leadership changes exacerbated the situation, contributing to market volatility and the dollar's weakening.

2. **Global Stock Market Surge:**
   - Global stock markets have reached new highs, partly driven by anticipated looser monetary and fiscal policies under the Trump administration, including potential tax cuts and deregulation. The Nasdaq 100 and MSCI's all-country index have hit record levels. However, there is caution over whether Federal Reserve rate cuts will occur as expected.

3. **Oil Price Increase:**
   - Oil prices are on the rise for the second consecutive day due to a ceasefire and nuclear talks between Israel and Iran, mediated by President Trump. These geopolitical developments have steered Brent crude and U.S. WTI prices higher.

4. **Philippines Economic Forecast Revision:**
   - The Philippine government revised its 2025 economic growth forecast downward due to global uncertainties, particularly Middle East tensions and U.S. trade policy changes. Inflation projections have been adjusted to a lower range, and a fiscal deficit widening is expected. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has responded with interest rate cuts.
