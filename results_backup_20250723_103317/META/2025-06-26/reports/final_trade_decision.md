RECOMMENDATION: BUY (with a disciplined, scale-in plan)

————————————————————————————————————
1.  WHAT EACH SIDE GOT RIGHT – AND WRONG  
   •  Risky Analyst:  
     “The 50- and 200-day SMA are both trending upward … potential Golden Cross.”  
     “AI investments are cementing its leadership position.”  
     Correctly highlights momentum and the cash-generating core ad engine, but downplays execution and regulatory risk.

   •  Safe/Conservative Analyst:  
     “RSI nearing 70 and prices approaching the upper Bollinger Band suggest caution.”  
     “Aggressive spending on AI could face regulatory obstacles and competition.”  
     Valid warning on near-term froth and open-ended Reality Labs spend; however, a blanket ‘wait and see’ ignores accelerating revenue and free-cash-flow that already fund those bets.

   •  Neutral Analyst:  
     “Optimizing entry points … staggered buys … options strategies could offer the growth potential while maintaining safety cushions.”  
     Captures the right blend—capture upside, but with guard-rails.

   My reading of the debate: fundamentals (20 %+ top-line and EPS growth, ~$50 B annual FCF, mid-20s P/E) and proven ad-monetisation cycles trump the known regulatory and sentiment risks. A HOLD would leave money on the table, and a SELL is not credible when both earnings and cash flow are re-accelerating.

2.  WHY BUY WINS—COUNTERING THE BEAR CASE DIRECTLY  
   •  “User backlash / privacy fines.”  Seven years of Cambridge-Analytica-era headlines have not knocked DAUs off trend; fines have been comfortably absorbed by cash flow.  
   •  “Overbought RSI.”  True (near 70), but momentum plus rising volume argues institutions are still accumulating. We respect, not fear, the chart by scaling in rather than chasing.  
   •  “Reality Labs is a money pit.”  Even if VR/AR never pays off, Reality Labs burn (<$15 B/yr) is ~30 % of FCF—containable. We embed a hard fundamental stop if that spend spikes without revenue traction.  
   •  “Macro shocks.”  Meta’s balance sheet is net-cash; ad growth has historically slowed but not reversed in recessions. Optional hedges (below) insure against a sudden risk-off.

3.  REFINED ACTION PLAN (BUILDING ON THE ORIGINAL)  

A. Position Size  
   •  Cap at 5 % of total equity book; start with 2.5 % now, leave 2.5 % dry powder.

B. Entry Grid  
   •  Buy 50 % of desired shares today.  
   •  Add 25 % if price pulls back 8 %.  
   •  Add final 25 % either on a 15 % pullback OR a post-earnings upside break-out accompanied by >20 % y/y revenue growth.

C. Options Overlay (optional but attractive)  
   •  Sell 60- to 90-day cash-secured puts one strike ~10 % below spot. Annualised yield >15 %; assignment simply accelerates the scale-in.  
   •  Finance a 12-month 20 % OTM protective put by writing a 3-month 10 % OTM covered call on half the position—a zero-premium collar that caps extreme downside.

D. Risk Guard-Rails  
   •  Technical stop: exit if the stock closes 20 % below its 200-day SMA.  
   •  Fundamental stop: trim/exit if (1) global DAUs fall >5 % for two straight quarters OR (2) Reality Labs spend exceeds $45 B in CY24 without at least $5 B revenue.  
   •  Macro trigger: if global ad spend contracts two consecutive quarters, tighten position to 3 % until trend stabilises.

E. Upside Target  
   •  12- to 18-month price objective ≈ 30 % above current levels (low- to mid-$900s on the debate’s price scale), assuming earnings CAGR in the low-20 s and a steady mid-20 s multiple.

4.  LESSONS APPLIED (AVOIDING PAST MISTAKES)  
   •  Don’t default to HOLD when the reward/risk skew is favourable—commit, but with structure.  
   •  Couple narrative conviction with explicit exit rules (technical AND fundamental).  
   •  Use options to turn volatility and elevated implied vols into yield or insurance.  
   •  Size appropriately—no thesis is bullet-proof.

————————————————————————————————————
BOTTOM LINE  
The core ad business is compounding, AI/Threads add upside optionality, and valuation is still undemanding for a >20 % grower. Near-term technical froth and long-standing regulatory risks are real but manageable with sizing, staggered entries, and hedges. Therefore, BUY—accumulate methodically rather than all at once.
