The additional indicators provide further confirmation of the current market situation for NFLX:

### Long-term Trend (200 SMA)
- The 200 SMA is steadily increasing, reaching about 945.07 in late June 2025, well below the current price (~1218.98). This signals a strong long-term bullish trend, with the current price well above the long-term support level, reinforcing a positive outlook.

### Volatility (Bollinger Middle)
- The Bollinger Middle line is around 1239.42 in late June 2025, slightly above the current price but close to recent highs. The price has been mostly riding above this SMA, indicating strong bullish momentum. If the price approaches or breaks above the upper Bollinger Band (not retrieved here), it could signal overbought conditions or potential breakout points.

### Momentum (RSI)
- The RSI values are in the high 50s to mid 70s, with recent data around 76.98 in late June 2025. An RSI nearing 77 suggests that the stock is in overbought territory, which might signal a short-term correction or consolidation. However, in strong uptrends, RSI can remain elevated longer, so this alone isn't necessarily a reversal indicator but warrants caution.

### Overall Synthesis:
- **Trend Confirmation:** The long-term (200 SMA) and medium-term (50 SMA) trends both point upwards.
- **Momentum:** The MACD and RSI indicate strong bullish momentum, but RSI is approaching overbought levels.
- **Volatility:** Price is riding above the Bollinger Middle line, supporting the bullish phase, but close monitoring for upper-band breakouts is advised.

### Implication:
- The technical picture suggests strong recent upside with sustained momentum. The overbought RSI hints at possible short-term pullback or sideways movement, but trend stabilization or a further breakout remains plausible if the momentum sustains.
- Caution is advised for traders considering new entries; watch for signs of divergence or MACD reversal for early warning of trend slowdown.

I will now compile this analysis into a summarized table of key points.
