It seems that the current tool setup does not support the specific API call needed to retrieve the data for NFLX. 

Given this limitation, I will provide a general analysis based on typical fundamental aspects of Netflix as of the latest data and trends up to October 2023, along with key points that are usually relevant in such assessments. 

Please let me know if you'd like a specific aspect to focus on, or if I should proceed with a generic detailed report based on known patterns and publicly available information up to late 2023.
