Based on the comprehensive analysis, technical overbought signals (RSI near 77, price significantly above the 200 SMA), macroeconomic headwinds, and concerns about diminishing international returns, the prudent course is to reduce exposure and prepare for a potential correction. The strategy emphasizes tight risk management through stop-loss orders and vigilant monitoring of macro and technical indicators for signs of reversal.

Drawing on past lessons, ignoring overextended technical indicators has led to losses; therefore, maintaining a cautious stance aligns with prudent risk mitigation. While Netflix's long-term outlook remains promising, current overbought conditions and macro risks advise caution.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
