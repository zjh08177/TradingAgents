Here is a comprehensive analysis report of Tesla Inc. (TSLA) based on recent social media trends, recent news, and public sentiment over the past week.

### Analysis of Recent Events and Social Media Trends

1. **Launch of Robotaxi Service in Austin, Texas**
   - The launch of Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin targeted at influential investors and social media personalities gained significant attention. Positive reviews, such as those from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who found the service "comfortable, safe, and personalized," could influence trader sentiment positively. The service indicates Tesla's continued investment and advancement in autonomous driving technology, crucial for future revenue streams.

2. **Increase in Tesla China Registrations**
   - The 49.3% week-on-week increase in Tesla's domestic registrations in China to 20,680 signifies strong market demand and penetration. China continues to be a critical market for Tesla, and such growth figures are likely to contribute positively to investor sentiment and stock performance, given the importance of the Chinese EV market.

3. **Feud Between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump**
   - The social media altercations between Elon Musk and President Trump, especially the criticisms from Musk on the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," have had significant adverse effects on Tesla's stock price, causing volatility and a notable 15% drop in early June. This reflects the high sensitivity of the stock to high-profile public disputes involving Musk.

4. **Tesla Takedown Protest Movement**
   - The ongoing global protest movement "Tesla Takedown" aims to economically challenge Tesla and Musk by urging divestment from Tesla's products and shares. Such movements could have a negative impact on public sentiment and investor confidence, although the tangible effect on sales and stock price is harder to quantify directly from these activities.

5. **Stock Performance Overview**
   - Throughout this period, Tesla's stock showed volatility largely due to the mixed nature of news and external factors. The stock saw a positive spike following the robotaxi service launch but suffered from the ongoing Musk-Trump feud. As of the latest market close, TSLA is down 18.6% for the year, closing at $317.66, with performance strongly influenced by external disputes and market perceptions.

### Implications for Traders and Investors

- Traders should monitor any further developments in the Elon Musk-Trump feud, as such high-profile disputes can lead to substantial stock volatility.
- The successful robotaxi launch suggests potential for growth in autonomous vehicle revenue, generally a positive signal for long-term investors.
- Growth in China remains a pivotal advantage; continued monitoring of registration numbers and policy changes in China can provide insights into market expansion.
- The social influence on Tesla through the "Tesla Takedown" might become relevant if it gains more traction, particularly affecting retail investor sentiment.

### Sentiment Analysis and Conclusion

In conclusion, the sentiment around Tesla has been a mix of positive expectations from its autonomous technology advances and negative pressures from political disputes and social movements. For now, holistic investor insight requires balancing these elements and factoring in the stock's current volatility when making decisions.
