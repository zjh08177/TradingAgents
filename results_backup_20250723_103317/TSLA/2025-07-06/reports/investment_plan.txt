Quick recap of the debate  

Bull’s best points  
• Still‐dominant scale: 384 k vehicles delivered and 9.6 GWh of storage in Q2’25 show that Tesla remains the largest, most vertically-integrated EV/clean-energy platform.  
• Multiple new growth vectors: Robotaxi, energy storage and software could reopen the S-curve.  
• Long-term trend lines (50- & 200-day SMAs) are rising, hinting that the secular bid is intact.  

Bear’s best points  
• Deliveries are falling two quarters in a row (-14 % y/y) while the stock trades at 173× earnings; the growth rate is slowing faster than the valuation is coming in.  
• Macro and policy overhangs: possible U.S. tariff hike August 1, China/Europe retaliation, and a securities-fraud probe—all real, near-dated catalysts.  
• Competition is biting (BYD, legacy OEMs) while Musk is distracted; Robotaxi faces thorny regulation, so the “next big thing” is timing-uncertain.  
• Momentum is cracking now: negative MACD crossover, 10-day EMA rollover. The short-term tape no longer supports the long-term narrative.  

Decision: SELL / UNDERWEIGHT  

Why the bear case wins  
1. Fundamental deceleration versus hyper-growth valuation. Two consecutive quarters of shrinking deliveries tell us the market is maturing faster than Tesla can open new profit pools. At 173× earnings, even small execution hiccups can knock 20–30 % off the share price.  
2. Imminent exogenous risks (tariffs, investigations) have binary outcomes and are not fully within management’s control. Your upside (an unannounced product pop) is speculative; the downside (regulatory, macro shock) is tangible, date-certain, and likely to move the stock first.  
3. Technical confirmation. When the short-term trend (10 EMA, MACD) rolls over against a still-elevated multiple, that is usually the front edge of multiple compression. Prior mistakes I’ve made involved hanging on to richly priced “story” stocks after momentum cracked—this time we act early.

Investment plan – how to execute the Sell call  

1. Position sizing  
• If you are long, trim 70 % of the position immediately at market.  
• Leave 30 % as a “stub” only if you want partial exposure to a positive July-10 announcement, but protect it with puts (see below).  

2. Hedging / Options  
• Buy 3- to 6-month 0.90-delta puts (roughly 10 % out-of-the-money) financed with out-of-the-money covered calls to cap upside you’re willing to forego.  
• Target net debit ≤2 % of notional; this limits drawdowns if an announcement spikes the stock.  

3. Re-entry framework  
• Re-evaluate after Q3 deliveries: look for YoY growth to re-accelerate to >10 % and gross margin to stabilize above 22 %.  
• Acceptable valuation re-entry band: forward P/E < 80 or EV/EBITDA < 40 with accelerating volumes.  

4. Stop-loss / discipline for shorts  
• If you choose an outright short (higher risk), size at ≤2 % portfolio NAV with a hard stop 15 % above entry (respect the power of Musk headlines).  

5. Monitoring catalysts  
• August 1 tariff decision (macro).  
• July 10 product event (headline risk).  
• Progress of DOJ/SEC investigations (legal).  
Document each event in the trading journal; adjust hedges the day before.  

Mistake avoidance learned  
In prior high-multiple momentum names (e.g., NVDA in 2022) I let the “story” override the slow rollover in deliveries and margins. This time the delivery decline is already here, the multiple is higher, and near-term catalysts skew negative. Acting decisively, not “holding and hoping,” is the improvement.

Bottom line  
Tesla may still define the future of transport and energy, but the stock right now prices in a flawless ramp. With growth slowing, competition rising, and policy/legal clouds forming, risk-reward has flipped. Reduce exposure, protect what remains with options, and wait for either a cheaper entry point or clear evidence of re-acceleration.
