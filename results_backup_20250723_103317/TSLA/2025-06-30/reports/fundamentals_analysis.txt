It appears that there is an issue with accessing the necessary fundamental data for Tesla (TSLA) using the current tool. Since I cannot retrieve real-time or recent data directly at this moment, I will provide a general overview based on existing knowledge up to October 2023, combined with the understanding that the company is a leading electric vehicle manufacturer with significant market influence.

However, for a detailed and up-to-date fundamental analysis, I recommend checking recent financial reports, SEC filings, insider transactions, and news sources. If you'd like, I can prepare a structured template for extracting or analyzing this data once access issues are resolved or suggest other ways to gather this information. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
