### Macroeconomic and Global Developments (June 22-29, 2025)

1. **Global Economic Outlook**
   - **BIS Annual Report**: The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has voiced concerns about a pivotal moment for the global economy characterized by rising trade tensions and geopolitical instability. Key risks include protectionism, demographic changes, and climate-related challenges impacting productivity and economic resilience.

2. **U.S. Fiscal Policy and Economic Concerns**
   - **Fiscal Trajectory**: Economists are alarmed by the U.S. fiscal path under the current administration due to significant spending and pressures on the Federal Reserve. This has led to concerns over the U.S. dollar's long-term value, which remains at a three-year low.

3. **Geopolitical Tensions and Economic Impacts**
   - **Middle East Conflict**: A recent 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran has highlighted shifts in safe-haven asset preferences, with reduced demand for U.S. Treasury bonds and a continued slide in the DXY index despite an initial oil price surge.
   - **Strait of Hormuz Threats**: Iran's potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz following U.S. military action could further disrupt global oil markets, with profound implications for energy security.

4. **Trade and Economic Indicators**
   - **Tariff Policies**: The U.S.'s escalating tariffs have strained economic relations within the USMCA region, affecting lumber, agriculture, and electronics markets, which could undermine supply chain resilience and economic cooperation.
   - **U.S. Economic Growth**: The U.S. economy showed a slight contraction in Q1 2025 but is forecasted to recover in Q2, with GDP growth expected to range between 1.2-1.9%. Consumer spending remains strong but is tempered by geopolitical uncertainties and tariff impacts.

5. **Market Trends**
   - **Equities and Commodities**: U.S. equities are underperforming compared to global markets, with a notable shift from U.S. assets to international equities. Commodities are poised for potential outperformance amid favorable economic signals, weaker dollar trends, and renewed global growth prospects.

6. **Upcoming Economic Events**
   - Despite a quiet week due to holidays, key economic indicators such as German inflation and U.S. employment data will be released, which are critical for gauging future economic conditions.
