DECISION: BUY – but do it the professional way, not the Reddit way.

────────────────────────────────
1.  WHAT THE THREE ANALYSTS REALLY SAID (30-second version)
• Risky/Bull:  “The AI build-out is a once-in-a-generation super-cycle.  Technicals are screaming ‘up,’ the product/​​software moat is unmatched, and past hesitation in similar paradigm shifts cost investors fortunes.”  
• Safe/Bear:  “At 75× forward EPS and an RSI > 70 this is priced for perfection.  One export-control headline, or AMD/​​in-house silicon taking share, and you’re long a crowded trade with 30 % downside in a week.”  
• Neutral:  “Both sides are right; the way through is phased sizing, explicit stop-losses, and live-fire monitoring of competitive data and macro headlines.”

All three agree on one underlying fact: NVIDIA is still growing explosively today.  The fight is over “price paid” and risk containment, not over whether the datacenter/AI story is real.

2.  WHY “BUY” WINS THE JUDGMENT
a.  Tangible backlog ≈ FY-25 revenue visibility  
   • Quote:  Risky Analyst – “Orders from hyperscalers are visible six-to-twelve months out; backlog covers most of FY25 targets.”  
   The bear case offered no evidence that those orders are drying up; therefore the base-line earnings power is hard, not hypothetical.

b.  Competitive moat still intact for at least one more product cycle  
   • Quote: Safe Analyst – “Competitors are constantly innovating.”  True, but today’s MI300 shipments and internal ASIC projects still leave NVIDIA with >80 % share and unmatched CUDA lock-in.  Risk here is medium-term, not immediate.

c.  Valuation risk is real, but manageable with structure  
   • Quote: Safe Analyst – “RSI overbought often precedes corrections.”  
   Counter-point: Neutral Analyst – “RSI can stay elevated in structural bull phases.”  
   History (e.g., AMZN 2009-2013) shows that expensive can stay expensive while earnings compound.  The solution is to control position size and add hedges, not to stand aside.

d.  Past lessons  
   • We lost money in 2022 hesitating on NVDA only to chase higher; we also lost in 2020 on ZM by ignoring stop-loss discipline.  The corrected playbook is: buy partial, hedge, enforce exits.

3.  REFINED TRADE PLAN  (changes vs. trader’s draft in ★bold italics)

Position Sizing & Entry  
• Start with 30 % of intended position now (cut from 40 %).  
• ★Add 30 % ONLY if the stock either  
   – pulls back 12-18 % into the 50-day moving average  ‑or-  
   – breaks to a new all-time high on >1.5× 20-day volume (a “momentum confirmation” add).  
• Final 40 % is contingent on next earnings: Data-center revenue must grow >25 % q/q and gross margin ≥ 74 %.  Miss either metric and we freeze sizing.

Risk Guardrails  
• ★Tighten trailing stop to 15 % on the first tranche; second and third tranches keep the 20 % stop.  
• Maintain 25-30 % notional hedge via 6-month 5 %-15 % OTM put spreads; roll every quarter.  
• If Washington widens China export controls to cover Blackwell chips, automatically take the position down by half the next day.

Income / Yield Enhancement  
• Covered-call program unchanged: write 1-SD OTM calls once any tranche is 15 % ITM, but cap coverage at 50 % of shares to preserve upside.

Portfolio Context  
• ★Hard-cap NVDA at 5 % net (after hedge) of total equity AUM, not 6 %.  Incremental AI exposure can be taken via equipment (ASML, LRCX) and software (MSFT, SNOW) to diversify factor risk.

Review Cadence & Kill-Switches  
• Earnings: tighten stops if sequential data-center growth slips below 15 % OR guidance implies FY revenue < +35 %.  
• Competitive watch: if AMD+in-house chips win >15 % of NEW AI server orders in any one quarter, exit half immediately.  
• Macro: a two-day close of SOX index below its 200-day MA triggers a full risk review and possible de-risking to ≤ 1 % weight.

4.  BOTTOM LINE
The bears identified the correct risk—valuation air-pockets—but failed to show an imminent catalyst that collapses earnings.  The bulls provided concrete demand data, and the neutral analyst supplied the operating manual for staying solvent if the crowd rushes for the exits.  A structured, rules-based BUY captures the upside while institutional-grade hedging and tight stops keep the mistake (if we’re wrong) survivable.

Action for the trader: Execute the refined phased-entry plan today, wire the put-spread hedge, and diary the next earnings date.
