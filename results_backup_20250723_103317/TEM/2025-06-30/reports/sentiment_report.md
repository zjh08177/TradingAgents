The search for "TEM" on social media did not yield specific posts related to the company for the timeframe I was looking at. It seems there may be some ambiguity in what "TEM" refers to.

For a comprehensive analysis as requested, it would be helpful to know more details about the "TEM" company you're interested in. Could you provide additional context or specify the industry or full company name? This will allow me to perform a more accurate and detailed inquiry.
