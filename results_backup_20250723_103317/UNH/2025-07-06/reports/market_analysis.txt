### 7. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**

## Conclusion
- **Short-term to Medium-term**: Indicators like the 10-Day EMA and MACD histogram suggest potential slowing in bearish momentum and might give early signs of a trend reversal. However, the overall medium-term trend as indicated by the 50-day SMA remains bearish.
  
- **Long-term**: With the 200-day SMA significantly above current prices, the long-term trend remains bearish. No immediate signs of a reversal are indicated in this timeframe.

The mixed signals suggest consolidative movement with previous bearish momentum potentially slowing. Traders may consider awaiting decisive price action before taking positions. Collaboration with further fundamental or event-driven analysis is advised for comprehensive decision-making.
