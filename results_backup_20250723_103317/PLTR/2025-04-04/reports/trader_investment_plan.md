Based on the comprehensive analysis, the proposed investment plan for Palantir (PLTR) seems prudent given the current market conditions and the significant potential in AI expansion and government contracts. The emphasis on dollar-cost averaging mitigates the risk of high volatility associated with Palantir's valuation. Additionally, diversification within the tech sector and the implementation of stop-loss strategies provide robust risk management.

From past experiences, trading tech stocks with high valuations without clear risk controls led to significant exposure risks. Therefore, it's critical to follow a disciplined approach, assessing macroeconomic indicators and pivotal contract developments.

In conclusion, the recommended strategy is to adopt a buy position for Palantir, focusing on gradual accumulation and vigilant monitoring of market and company-specific developments.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
