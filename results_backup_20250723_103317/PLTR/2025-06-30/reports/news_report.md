**Global Macroeconomic Overview (June 23-30, 2025)**

**1. Geopolitical Tensions and Oil Prices**
- Middle Eastern conflicts, notably between Iran and Israel, have modestly increased oil price forecasts, although the market remains stable around $70.80 for Brent and $67.50 for U.S. crude. The principal concerns continue to be elevated OPEC+ production and lower demand expectations ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/geopolitical-tensions-nudge-oil-outlook-higher-demand-concerns-persist-2025-06-30/?utm_source=openai)).

**2. U.S. Trade Policy Uncertainty**
- Upcoming July 9 deadline for potential reinstatement of tariffs by the U.S. President sparks uncertainty. Only two formal trade deals completed (UK and China), with a potential extension of talks with other nations such as India and Canada. Reintroduction of tariffs could lead to market volatility, especially concerning equity and bond markets ([MoneyWeek](https://moneyweek.com/investments/stock-markets/will-liberation-day-strike-again-trump-9-july-deadline?utm_source=openai)).

**4. Euro's Strength and Investment Shifts**

**5. NATO's Defense Spending Increase**
- NATO agreed to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, boosting U.S. defense contractor demand, evidenced by a rise in iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/24/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?utm_source=openai)).

**6. Iran's Threat to Close the Strait of Hormuz**
- Iranian parliament votes to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz following U.S. actions, introducing volatility despite no actual closure ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iran_threat_of_Strait_of_Hormuz_closure?utm_source=openai)).
