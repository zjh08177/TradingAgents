Let’s step back and weigh what was actually said.

Key bull points  
• 39 % YoY revenue growth to roughly $884 M and guidance for $1.6-$1.8 B in free cash flow by 2025.  
• Deep, sticky relationships with U.S. defense & intelligence plus a fresh Accenture Federal Services deal—hard for newcomers to replicate.  
• 87 % YTD price appreciation, growing institutional ownership (≈45 %), and PLTR’s two core platforms (Gotham & Foundry) regarded as category leaders in mission-critical data analytics/AI.  

Key bear points  
• Valuation is nose-bleed: ~275× trailing earnings, ~199× forward, mid-20s price-to-sales. The stock is “priced for perfection.”  
• MACD rolling over, histogram negative—momentum is cooling just as retail enthusiasm is peaking.  
• Competitive threats from hyperscalers and diversified tech firms with deeper pockets; government contracts are competitive bid-outs, not annuities.  
• Any macro hiccup (budget fight, tariff, rate spike) could push institutions to cut a richly valued name first, exacerbating downside.  

My decision  
I side with the bear: Sell / Take Profits.

Why I’m comfortable being decisive  
1. The bull case (AI optionality, government moat, high growth) is no secret—the market already capitalizes it at ~275× earnings. We’re paying up for a story everyone knows.  
2. Even if PLTR hits its 2025 FCF midpoint ($1.7 B), today’s price implies an 3-4 % forward FCF yield—still expensive for a company that must keep reinvesting heavily to stay ahead of Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, Snowflake, etc.  
3. Technicals are rolling over, and we have a recent 87 % run-up. Risk/reward is now skewed: one disappointment (slower contract wins, budget delay, margin miss) could chop 30-40 % off the stock faster than fundamental progress can rebuild it.  
4. In past calls I’ve been guilty of defaulting to “Hold” when valuations felt stretched but the story sounded good. History shows that in richly priced momentum names a small fundamental miss leads to big drawdowns. I will not repeat that mistake.

Investment plan  

1. Position exit  
   • Sell the entire position over the next 3-5 sessions using VWAP-linked limit orders to avoid signaling.  
   • If the position is large, stage in 25 % blocks daily; attach a 1 %-of-ADV cap to stay invisible.  

2. Risk-controlled fallback (optional for tax-sensitive accounts)  
   • If you need to keep a toehold, roll half the shares into deep-in-the-money January covered calls (strike 10-15 % below spot). That locks in most gains, generates premium, and forces discipline if the stock slips.  

3. Redeploy proceeds  
   • Park 50 % in T-Bills or a short-term bond ETF—earn risk-free ~5 %.  
   • Allocate 30 % to a diversified AI/automation ETF (BOTZ, ROBO, or similar) to keep thematic exposure with far lower single-name risk.  
   • Keep 20 % dry powder to buy PLTR or peers later should valuations compress (P/S <10, FCF yield >5 %, or after a 30 % drawdown paired with a MACD bullish crossover).  

4. Guardrails & review  
   • Hard stop for any residual PLTR exposure at 15 % below current price.  
   • Re-evaluate quarterly—if PLTR grows revenue >30 % AND expands FCF margin to >20 % while P/S falls into the teens, reconsider a starter position.  

Bottom line  
Great company, lousy entry point. Cash in the gains, reduce single-name risk, and be ready to revisit after the inevitable shake-out rather than riding it down.
