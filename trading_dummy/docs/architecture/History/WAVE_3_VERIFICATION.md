## 🧪 How to Verify Wave 3

### 1. Run Unit Tests
```bash
cd /Users/bytedance/Documents/TradingAgents/trading_dummy
flutter test test/history/use_cases/use_cases_test.dart
```

Expected output: All 20 tests pass

### 2. Test in App
```bash
flutter run
```

1. Login to the app
2. Tap "Test History (Wave 2)" button
3. Test the following:
