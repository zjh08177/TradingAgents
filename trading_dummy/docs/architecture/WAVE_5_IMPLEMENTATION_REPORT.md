  - Static methods for box management (openBox, closeBox, isBoxOpen)
  - Automatic sorting by timestamp (newest first)

#### 5.2 Hive Initialization ✅
- **File**: `lib/main.dart`
- **Lines Added**: 15 (target: 30)
- **Changes**:
  - Added Hive imports
  - Added Hive initialization after environment loading
  - Register HiveHistoryEntry and HiveAnalysisDetails adapters
  - Open history box on startup
  - Proper logging for initialization status

## 🧪 Testing

### Integration Test Created ✅
- **File**: `test/history/infrastructure/repositories/hive_history_repository_test.dart`
- **Test Cases**: 9 comprehensive tests
  - Save and retrieve by ID
  - Get all entries (sorted)
  - Filter by ticker
  - Delete entry
  - Clear all entries
  - Complex analysis details handling
  - Error entry handling
  - Box operation verification

## 📦 Dependencies

### Added to pubspec.yaml ✅
```yaml
dependencies:
  hive: ^2.2.3

- ✅ Box opened on app startup
- ✅ Dependencies added to pubspec.yaml
- ✅ Generated files created successfully

### Testing
- ✅ Comprehensive integration tests written
- ✅ All CRUD operations tested
- ✅ Edge cases covered (error entries, complex details)
- ✅ Sorting and filtering verified

## 📊 Quality Metrics

### Code Quality
- Clean separation between domain and infrastructure
- Proper use of dependency injection pattern
- Good error handling and meaningful exceptions
- Clear method naming and documentation

### Test Coverage
- All public methods tested
- Both success and error scenarios covered
- Complex data structures tested
- Lifecycle operations verified

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ Hive repository fully implements IHistoryRepository
2. ✅ Integration test suite passes
3. ✅ Main.dart properly initializes Hive
4. ✅ All dependencies configured
5. ✅ Generated files created
6. ✅ No analyzer errors in new code
7. ✅ Ready for Wave 6 (Screens) integration

## 📝 Next Steps

With Wave 5 complete, the History feature now has:
- ✅ Domain layer (Wave 1)
- ✅ Infrastructure with Hive (Wave 2 & 5)
- ✅ Use cases (Wave 3)
- ✅ UI components (Wave 4)
- ✅ Persistence layer (Wave 5)

Ready for Wave 6: History and Detail screens implementation!

## 🏆 Overall Assessment

Wave 5 implementation is **COMPLETE** and fully functional. The Hive repository provides reliable persistence for the History feature with proper error handling, testing, and integration with the Flutter app lifecycle.
