# Wave 2 Implementation - Fixes Summary

## 🐛 Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Unit Test File
**Problem**: `test/test_wave2_integration.dart` was not created
**Solution**: Created the complete test file with 7 comprehensive tests covering:
- ReportMapper decision extraction
- Error report handling
- Repository CRUD operations
- Confidence extraction variations
- Summary generation
- Ticker filtering

### Issue 2: Missing "Test History (Wave 2)" Button
**Problem**: The test button was not visible in the home screen
**Solution**: 
1. Added import for `TestHistoryScreen` in `home_screen.dart`
2. Added `_buildTestSection` method to create the test button
3. Conditionally displayed the button in debug mode using `kDebugMode`
4. Button appears in "Development Testing" section below Quick Actions

### Issue 3: Missing Infrastructure Files
**Problem**: Test imports couldn't find the infrastructure files
**Solution**: Created all missing files:
- `lib/history/infrastructure/models/hive_history_entry.dart`
- `lib/history/infrastructure/models/hive_analysis_details.dart`
- `lib/history/infrastructure/mappers/report_mapper.dart`
- `lib/history/infrastructure/repositories/mock_history_repository.dart`
- `lib/screens/test_history_screen.dart`

### Issue 4: Incorrect Logger Import
**Problem**: ReportMapper was using wrong logger import path
**Solution**: Changed from `package:trading_dummy/utils/logger.dart` to `package:trading_dummy/core/logging/app_logger.dart`

## ✅ Verification Results

### Unit Tests
- **Total Tests**: 7
- **Status**: All passing ✅

### Features Working
1. **ReportMapper**: Correctly extracts decisions, confidence, and summaries
2. **MockHistoryRepository**: Provides 3 pre-populated entries (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT)
3. **TestHistoryScreen**: Visual verification with interactive testing
4. **Test Button**: Visible in debug mode on home screen

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Run Unit Tests**:
   ```bash
   flutter test test/test_wave2_integration.dart
   ```

2. **Test in App**:

   flutter run
   ```
   - Login to the app
   - Scroll to bottom of home screen
   - Look for "Development Testing" section
   - Tap "Test History (Wave 2)" button
   - Test mapper functionality and view entries

## 📊 Wave 2 Status: COMPLETE ✅

All Wave 2 functionality has been implemented and verified:
- Infrastructure layer with Hive models (ready for adapter generation)
- ReportMapper with intelligent extraction logic
- MockHistoryRepository with test data
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Visual test screen for manual verification
- All code compiles and runs correctly
