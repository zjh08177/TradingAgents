# Phase 5 Completion Summary: Gradual Rollout to Default SQLite

## Overview
Phase 5 of the Hive to SQLite migration has been successfully implemented, providing a complete gradual rollout system with automatic migration, user controls, and percentage-based deployment capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Migration Manager (`lib/migration/services/migration_manager.dart`)
A comprehensive migration orchestration service that handles:

#### Key Features:
- **Migration State Management**
  - Tracks migration status (not_started, in_progress, completed, failed, rolled_back)
  - Stores migration timestamp and version
  - Provides rollback capabilities

- **Gradual Rollout Control**
  - Percentage-based rollout (0-100%)
  - Stable device ID generation for consistent user assignment
  - User opt-in/opt-out capabilities via SharedPreferences

- **Repository Selection Logic**
  ```dart
  shouldUseSQLite() checks in order:
  1. Environment variable (USE_SQLITE) for testing
  2. User preference (manual opt-in)
  3. Migration completion status
  4. Rollout percentage assignment
  ```

- **Automatic Migration**
  - Performs migration with validation
  - Handles migration failures gracefully
  - Provides detailed migration reports

### 2. Migration Control Screen (`lib/migration/screens/migration_control_screen.dart`)
A comprehensive UI for managing the migration process:

#### UI Components:
- **Migration Status Card**
  - Visual status indicator with color coding
  - Current database in use (Hive vs SQLite)
  - Migration version tracking
  - Last activity timestamp

- **Migration Actions**
  - Start Migration button (when not started or failed)
  - Validate button (after completion)
  - Rollback button (to revert to Hive)
  - Reset button (clear migration data)

- **Gradual Rollout Controls**
  - Slider for rollout percentage (0-100%)
  - Text input for precise percentage
  - Update button to apply changes
  - Current rollout status display

- **Database Selection Toggle**
  - Manual switch between Hive and SQLite
  - Real-time database switching
  - Visual feedback on current selection

- **Statistics Dashboard**
  - Migration status and metrics
  - Database currently in use
  - Migration version
  - Rollout percentage
  - Last activity time

- **Migration Report Card**
  - Success/failure status
  - Duration of migration
  - Items processed and failed
  - Copy report to clipboard functionality

### 3. App Integration Updates (`lib/main.dart`)

#### Initialization Flow:
1. **Migration Manager Creation**
   ```dart
   final migrationManager = await MigrationManager.create();
   ```

2. **Automatic Migration Check**
   ```dart
   if (migrationManager.isMigrationNeeded() && !migrationManager.isMigrationInProgress()) {
     final result = await migrationManager.performMigration(validateAfter: true);
   }
   ```

3. **Repository Selection**
   ```dart
   final shouldUseSQLite = await migrationManager.shouldUseSQLite();
   // Initialize appropriate repository based on migration status
   ```

4. **Route Configuration**
   - Added `/migration-control` route for Migration Control Screen
   - Accessible from home screen via "Migration Control" tile

### 4. Service Provider Updates (`lib/services/service_provider.dart`)

#### Enhanced Repository Factory:
- Accepts MigrationManager for intelligent repository selection
- Checks migration status for automatic SQLite enablement
- Falls back to environment variables when migration manager unavailable
- Provides detailed logging of repository selection reasoning

### 5. Home Screen Integration (`lib/auth/screens/home_screen.dart`)
- Added "Migration Control" tile with admin panel icon
- Indigo color scheme for visual distinction
- Direct navigation to migration control center

## Migration Flow

### Automatic Migration Flow:
1. **App Startup**
   - MigrationManager checks if migration is needed
   - Automatically performs migration if not started
   - Validates migration after completion

2. **Repository Selection**
   - Checks environment variables (testing)
   - Checks user preferences (manual control)
   - Checks migration status
   - Applies rollout percentage logic

3. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Admin sets rollout percentage (e.g., 10%)
   - Users are assigned based on stable device ID hash
   - Consistent assignment across app restarts

### Manual Control Flow:
1. **Migration Control Screen**
   - Admin can manually trigger migration
   - Adjust rollout percentage in real-time
   - Force enable/disable SQLite
   - Monitor migration statistics

2. **Rollback Capability**
   - One-click rollback to Hive
   - Preserves all data
   - Updates status to "rolled_back"
   - Instant effect on repository selection

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Multi-Level Control**
- Environment variables for development/testing
- User preferences for manual override
- Migration status for automatic progression
- Rollout percentage for gradual deployment

### 2. **Stable User Assignment**
- Device ID based on first app launch timestamp
- Consistent hash-based assignment
- No flip-flopping between databases

### 3. **Safety First**
- Automatic validation after migration
- Rollback capability always available
- Clear status tracking and reporting
- No data loss during transitions

### 4. **Progressive Enhancement**
- Start with 0% rollout (Hive only)
- Gradually increase to test stability
- Monitor metrics and user feedback
- Full rollout when confident

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables:
```bash
# Force SQLite usage (testing)
flutter run --dart-define=USE_SQLITE=true
```

### SharedPreferences Keys:
- `sqlite_migration_status` - Current migration status
- `sqlite_migration_timestamp` - Last migration activity
- `sqlite_migration_version` - Migration version number
- `sqlite_rollout_percentage` - Current rollout percentage
- `use_sqlite_database` - User preference override

### Rollout Strategies:

#### Conservative Rollout:
- Week 1: 0% (migration only, no users)
- Week 2: 5% (early adopters)
- Week 3: 25% (broader testing)
- Week 4: 50% (half of users)
- Week 5: 100% (full rollout)

#### Aggressive Rollout:
- Day 1: 10% (initial test)
- Day 3: 50% (if stable)
- Day 7: 100% (full deployment)

#### A/B Testing:
- 50% on SQLite, 50% on Hive
- Compare performance metrics
- Make decision based on data

## Test Plans and Verification

### Migration Manager Testing

#### Unit Tests:
**Test File**: `test/migration/services/migration_manager_test.dart` (to be created)
**How to Run**: `flutter test test/migration/services/migration_manager_test.dart`

**What to Verify**:
- Migration status tracking
- Rollout percentage calculations
- Repository selection logic
- User assignment consistency

### In-App Manual Testing

#### 1. Migration Control Screen Testing
**Access**: Home Screen â†’ Migration Control tile

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Initial State Verification**:
   - Status should show "Not Started"
   - Database should show "Hive"
   - Rollout should be 0%

2. **Migration Execution**:
   - Tap "Start Migration"
   - Verify progress indicator appears
   - Check success message
   - Verify status changes to "Completed"

3. **Rollout Percentage Testing**:
   - Set rollout to 50%
   - Tap "Update Rollout Percentage"
   - Verify some users get SQLite, others stay on Hive

4. **Manual Database Toggle**:
   - Toggle "Use SQLite Database" switch
   - Verify immediate database change
   - Check data accessibility

5. **Rollback Testing**:
   - After migration, tap "Rollback"
   - Verify status changes to "Rolled Back"
   - Confirm database reverts to Hive

#### 2. Automatic Migration Testing
**How to Test**:
```bash
# Clear app data first, then run:
flutter run

# Check logs for:
# "ðŸ”„ Starting automatic database migration..."
# "âœ… Database migration completed successfully"
```

#### 3. Environment Variable Testing
```bash
# Force SQLite usage
flutter run --dart-define=USE_SQLITE=true

# Verify in logs:
# "SQLite enabled via environment variable"
```
