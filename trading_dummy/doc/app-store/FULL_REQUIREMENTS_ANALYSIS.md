## 🎯 Conclusion

The Trading Dummy app has a solid foundation but needs approximately **7-10 days of focused development** to meet App Store requirements. The most critical items are:

1. **Legal documents** (Privacy Policy, ToS, Disclaimer)
2. **User onboarding** and error handling
3. **Accessibility** compliance
4. **App Store assets** (screenshots, description)

With these additions, the app should pass Apple's review process successfully. The current architecture is sound, and the existing authentication and analysis features provide good value to users.
