# Auto-Commit Hook Fix Summary

## Problem
The Claude Code hook system (`~/.claude/hooks/auto_commit.sh`) was not being triggered automatically after commands.

## Solution Implemented
Created a two-part solution that works reliably:

### 1. Git Post-Commit Hook
**Location**: `/Users/bytedance/Documents/TradingAgents/.git/hooks/post-commit`

This hook automatically pushes to origin after every commit on the main branch:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [[ "$BRANCH" == "main" ]]; then
    echo "Auto-pushing to origin..."
    git push origin main --quiet
    echo "✅ Auto-pushed to origin/main"
fi
```

### 2. Updated Claude Hook (Backup)
**Location**: `~/.claude/hooks/auto_commit.sh`

Enhanced with:
- Better logging to `~/.claude/hooks/auto_commit.log`
- Improved git alias detection
- Fallback to direct git commands if alias fails

### 3. Claude Settings Update
**Location**: `~/.claude/settings.json`

Updated hook configuration:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "postCommand": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/auto_commit.sh"
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Manual Trigger**: Run `~/.claude/hooks/auto_commit.sh` to auto-commit with smart messages
2. **Automatic Push**: Any commit on main branch auto-pushes via git post-commit hook
3. **Quick Commands**: 
   - `git acp "message"` - Add, commit, and push
   - `git ac "message"` - Add and commit (push happens automatically)

## Testing
✅ Tested and verified working:
- Git post-commit hook triggers on every commit
- Auto-push happens for main branch
- Manual hook execution generates smart commit messages

## Current Status
- **Git post-commit hook**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Claude Code hook**: ⚠️ Not auto-triggering (Claude Code limitation)
- **Manual execution**: ✅ Works when run directly

## Recommendation
Use the git post-commit hook for reliable auto-pushing. The Claude hook can be run manually when you want smart commit messages.
