# Trading Dummy App - Authentication Flow Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Auto-search TSLA Feature Removal
- **File**: `lib/services/auto_test.dart`
- **Change**: Set `_isEnabled = false` to disable the 2-second auto-search
- **Result**: App will no longer automatically search for TSLA after launch

### 2. Authentication Integration 
- **File**: `lib/main.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added authentication imports and providers
  - Created `TradingApp` class with authentication support
  - Added `AuthGuard` widget to protect routes
  - Created `ServiceProvider` for dependency injection
  - Added navigation routes for auth screens

### 3. Supporting Files Created
- `lib/services/service_provider.dart` - Manages app-wide services
- `lib/pages/analysis_page_wrapper.dart` - Wraps SimpleAnalysisPage with services

## Expected Flow

1. **App Launch**: Shows SplashScreen (`/` route)
2. **Auth Check**: SplashScreen checks authentication status
3. **Login Screen**: If not authenticated, redirects to LoginScreen (`/login` route)
4. **Authentication**: User logs in with Google or Apple
5. **Home Screen**: After successful auth, shows HomeScreen (`/home` route)
6. **Analysis Access**: From HomeScreen, user can navigate to analysis page

## Running the App

To run with authentication:
```bash
flutter run lib/main.dart
```

To run without authentication (old behavior):
```bash
flutter run lib/main_auth_example.dart
```

## Key Features
- Auto-search TSLA is now disabled
- Authentication is required before accessing any features
- Analysis page is protected by AuthGuard
- Services are properly injected through ServiceProvider
