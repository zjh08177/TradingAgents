# Smart IP Detection for iOS/macOS Cross-Platform Connectivity

## Problem Solved
iOS simulator/device couldn't connect to `127.0.0.1:8000` because:
- iOS runs in a different network context than the host Mac
- `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` only refer to the device itself, not the Mac
- Need to use the Mac's actual local network IP address

## Solution: Smart Network Detection

### 1. **NetworkService** (`lib/services/network_service.dart`)
- **Auto-detects local IP**: Scans network interfaces for IPv4 addresses
- **Prioritizes local networks**: Prefers 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x ranges
- **Generates fallback URLs**: Creates list of possible server URLs to try
- **Tests connectivity**: Checks if each URL is reachable before using it

### 2. **Smart Connection Logic** (Updated `main.dart`)
- **Multiple URL attempts**: Tries auto-detected IP, common IPs, then localhost
- **Health check each URL**: Tests `/health` endpoint for each URL
- **First working URL wins**: Uses the first reachable server
- **Dynamic status display**: Shows the actual connected URL in the UI

### 3. **Server Configuration**
- **Bind to all interfaces**: Server runs on `0.0.0.0:8000` (not just `127.0.0.1`)
- **Network accessible**: Can be reached from iOS via Mac's local IP
- **Your Mac's IP**: `10.73.204.80` (auto-detected)

## Key Benefits
âœ… **Cross-platform**: Works on iOS, macOS, Android, web  
âœ… **Auto-detection**: No manual IP configuration needed  
âœ… **Fallback resilient**: Tries multiple URLs until one works  
âœ… **Network-aware**: Adapts to different network configurations  
âœ… **Real-time status**: Shows actual connected URL in UI  

## Expected Behavior
1. **App starts**: "Detecting local network configuration..."
2. **Tries URLs in order**:
   - `http://10.73.204.80:8000` (auto-detected Mac IP)
   - Common local IPs (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x)
   - `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (localhost fallback)
3. **Connects to first working URL**: Shows "Connected to: http://10.73.204.80:8000"
4. **Triggers automated test**: TSLA analysis after 2 seconds

## Server Status
- âœ… Running on `0.0.0.0:8000` (all interfaces)
- âœ… Accessible at `http://10.73.204.80:8000/health`
- âœ… Returns `{"status":"healthy"}`

The iOS app should now automatically detect and connect to your Mac's LangGraph server! ðŸš€
