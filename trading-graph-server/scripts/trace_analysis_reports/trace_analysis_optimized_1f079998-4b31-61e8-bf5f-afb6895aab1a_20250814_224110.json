Confidence Level\nThe confidence levels from the sources are:\n- Reddit: High\n- Twitter: Medium\n- StockTwits: High\n\nGiven that Twitter has limited data (just 2 mentions), the overall confidence level is **Medium** based on the lower confidence from that source.\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince the sentiment scores across platforms are predominantly above 0.9 (highly positive), and the primary source (Reddit) has a high volume of posts with an even higher confidence level, we can categorize the sentiment trend as **Stable**.\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Positive Sentiment**: Reddit shows a very high average sentiment score of 0.978, indicating a strong positive perception about ETH among users, despite its dominant share of engagement.\n2. **Limited Twitter Feedback**: With only 2 mentions on Twitter, sentiment analysis from that source might not fully capture the broader market trends or opinions. This could limit the overall perspective.\n3. **Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits**: StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment with 63.3% of users expressing positive views, supporting the overall positive sentiment from Reddit.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall sentiment score of approximately 0.942 and the bullish sentiment notes on both StockTwits and Reddit, the trading signal should be a **BUY**. This recommendation stems from:\n\n- Strong positive sentiment on Reddit and StockTwits.\n- High engagement and discussion levels on Reddit (85 posts analyzed).\n- A consistent bullish narrative across the main platforms.\n\nHowever, one should note the limited data on Twitter, indicating the need for caution and consideration of broader market factors when making trading decisions.",

Confidence Level\nThe confidence levels from the sources are:\n- Reddit: High\n- Twitter: Medium\n- StockTwits: High\n\nGiven that Twitter has limited data (just 2 mentions), the overall confidence level is **Medium** based on the lower confidence from that source.\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince the sentiment scores across platforms are predominantly above 0.9 (highly positive), and the primary source (Reddit) has a high volume of posts with an even higher confidence level, we can categorize the sentiment trend as **Stable**.\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Positive Sentiment**: Reddit shows a very high average sentiment score of 0.978, indicating a strong positive perception about ETH among users, despite its dominant share of engagement.\n2. **Limited Twitter Feedback**: With only 2 mentions on Twitter, sentiment analysis from that source might not fully capture the broader market trends or opinions. This could limit the overall perspective.\n3. **Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits**: StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment with 63.3% of users expressing positive views, supporting the overall positive sentiment from Reddit.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall sentiment score of approximately 0.942 and the bullish sentiment notes on both StockTwits and Reddit, the trading signal should be a **BUY**. This recommendation stems from:\n\n- Strong positive sentiment on Reddit and StockTwits.\n- High engagement and discussion levels on Reddit (85 posts analyzed).\n- A consistent bullish narrative across the main platforms.\n\nHowever, one should note the limited data on Twitter, indicating the need for caution and consideration of broader market factors when making trading decisions.",

Confidence Level\nThe confidence levels from the sources are:\n- Reddit: High\n- Twitter: Medium\n- StockTwits: High\n\nGiven that Twitter has limited data (just 2 mentions), the overall confidence level is **Medium** based on the lower confidence from that source.\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince the sentiment scores across platforms are predominantly above 0.9 (highly positive), and the primary source (Reddit) has a high volume of posts with an even higher confidence level, we can categorize the sentiment trend as **Stable**.\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Positive Sentiment**: Reddit shows a very high average sentiment score of 0.978, indicating a strong positive perception about ETH among users, despite its dominant share of engagement.\n2. **Limited Twitter Feedback**: With only 2 mentions on Twitter, sentiment analysis from that source might not fully capture the broader market trends or opinions. This could limit the overall perspective.\n3. **Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits**: StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment with 63.3% of users expressing positive views, supporting the overall positive sentiment from Reddit.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall sentiment score of approximately 0.942 and the bullish sentiment notes on both StockTwits and Reddit, the trading signal should be a **BUY**. This recommendation stems from:\n\n- Strong positive sentiment on Reddit and StockTwits.\n- High engagement and discussion levels on Reddit (85 posts analyzed).\n- A consistent bullish narrative across the main platforms.\n\nHowever, one should note the limited data on Twitter, indicating the need for caution and consideration of broader market factors when making trading decisions.",

Confidence Level\nThe confidence levels from the sources are:\n- Reddit: High\n- Twitter: Medium\n- StockTwits: High\n\nGiven that Twitter has limited data (just 2 mentions), the overall confidence level is **Medium** based on the lower confidence from that source.\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince the sentiment scores across platforms are predominantly above 0.9 (highly positive), and the primary source (Reddit) has a high volume of posts with an even higher confidence level, we can categorize the sentiment trend as **Stable**.\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Positive Sentiment**: Reddit shows a very high average sentiment score of 0.978, indicating a strong positive perception about ETH among users, despite its dominant share of engagement.\n2. **Limited Twitter Feedback**: With only 2 mentions on Twitter, sentiment analysis from that source might not fully capture the broader market trends or opinions. This could limit the overall perspective.\n3. **Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits**: StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment with 63.3% of users expressing positive views, supporting the overall positive sentiment from Reddit.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall sentiment score of approximately 0.942 and the bullish sentiment notes on both StockTwits and Reddit, the trading signal should be a **BUY**. This recommendation stems from:\n\n- Strong positive sentiment on Reddit and StockTwits.\n- High engagement and discussion levels on Reddit (85 posts analyzed).\n- A consistent bullish narrative across the main platforms.\n\nHowever, one should note the limited data on Twitter, indicating the need for caution and consideration of broader market factors when making trading decisions.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate an overall sentiment score based on the available data:\n\n- **Reddit Sentiment Score**: 0.978\n- **Twitter Sentiment Score**: 0.947\n- **StockTwits Sentiment Score**: 0.9\n\nTo find the average:\n\\[\n\\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.978 + 0.947 + 0.9)}{3} \\approx 0.94167\n\\]\n**Final Overall Sentiment Score**: **0.942** (rounded)\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nThe confidence levels from the sources are:\n- Reddit: High\n- Twitter: Medium\n- StockTwits: High\n\nGiven that Twitter has limited data (just 2 mentions), the overall confidence level is **Medium** based on the lower confidence from that source.\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince the sentiment scores across platforms are predominantly above 0.9 (highly positive), and the primary source (Reddit) has a high volume of posts with an even higher confidence level, we can categorize the sentiment trend as **Stable**.\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Positive Sentiment**: Reddit shows a very high average sentiment score of 0.978, indicating a strong positive perception about ETH among users, despite its dominant share of engagement.\n2. **Limited Twitter Feedback**: With only 2 mentions on Twitter, sentiment analysis from that source might not fully capture the broader market trends or opinions. This could limit the overall perspective.\n3. **Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits**: StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment with 63.3% of users expressing positive views, supporting the overall positive sentiment from Reddit.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall sentiment score of approximately 0.942 and the bullish sentiment notes on both StockTwits and Reddit, the trading signal should be a **BUY**. This recommendation stems from:\n\n- Strong positive sentiment on Reddit and StockTwits.\n- High engagement and discussion levels on Reddit (85 posts analyzed).\n- A consistent bullish narrative across the main platforms.\n\nHowever, one should note the limited data on Twitter, indicating the need for caution and consideration of broader market factors when making trading decisions.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate an overall sentiment score based on the available data:\n\n- **Reddit Sentiment Score**: 0.978\n- **Twitter Sentiment Score**: 0.947\n- **StockTwits Sentiment Score**: 0.9\n\nTo find the average:\n\\[\n\\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.978 + 0.947 + 0.9)}{3} \\approx 0.94167\n\\]\n**Final Overall Sentiment Score**: **0.942** (rounded)\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nThe confidence levels from the sources are:\n- Reddit: High\n- Twitter: Medium\n- StockTwits: High\n\nGiven that Twitter has limited data (just 2 mentions), the overall confidence level is **Medium** based on the lower confidence from that source.\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince the sentiment scores across platforms are predominantly above 0.9 (highly positive), and the primary source (Reddit) has a high volume of posts with an even higher confidence level, we can categorize the sentiment trend as **Stable**.\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Positive Sentiment**: Reddit shows a very high average sentiment score of 0.978, indicating a strong positive perception about ETH among users, despite its dominant share of engagement.\n2. **Limited Twitter Feedback**: With only 2 mentions on Twitter, sentiment analysis from that source might not fully capture the broader market trends or opinions. This could limit the overall perspective.\n3. **Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits**: StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment with 63.3% of users expressing positive views, supporting the overall positive sentiment from Reddit.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall sentiment score of approximately 0.942 and the bullish sentiment notes on both StockTwits and Reddit, the trading signal should be a **BUY**. This recommendation stems from:\n\n- Strong positive sentiment on Reddit and StockTwits.\n- High engagement and discussion levels on Reddit (85 posts analyzed).\n- A consistent bullish narrative across the main platforms.\n\nHowever, one should note the limited data on Twitter, indicating the need for caution and consideration of broader market factors when making trading decisions.",

Confidence Level\nThe confidence levels from the sources are:\n- Reddit: High\n- Twitter: Medium\n- StockTwits: High\n\nGiven that Twitter has limited data (just 2 mentions), the overall confidence level is **Medium** based on the lower confidence from that source.\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince the sentiment scores across platforms are predominantly above 0.9 (highly positive), and the primary source (Reddit) has a high volume of posts with an even higher confidence level, we can categorize the sentiment trend as **Stable**.\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Positive Sentiment**: Reddit shows a very high average sentiment score of 0.978, indicating a strong positive perception about ETH among users, despite its dominant share of engagement.\n2. **Limited Twitter Feedback**: With only 2 mentions on Twitter, sentiment analysis from that source might not fully capture the broader market trends or opinions. This could limit the overall perspective.\n3. **Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits**: StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment with 63.3% of users expressing positive views, supporting the overall positive sentiment from Reddit.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall sentiment score of approximately 0.942 and the bullish sentiment notes on both StockTwits and Reddit, the trading signal should be a **BUY**. This recommendation stems from:\n\n- Strong positive sentiment on Reddit and StockTwits.\n- High engagement and discussion levels on Reddit (85 posts analyzed).\n- A consistent bullish narrative across the main platforms.\n\nHowever, one should note the limited data on Twitter, indicating the need for caution and consideration of broader market factors when making trading decisions.",

Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Positive Sentiment**: Reddit shows a very high average sentiment score of 0.978, indicating a strong positive perception about ETH among users, despite its dominant share of engagement.\n2. **Limited Twitter Feedback**: With only 2 mentions on Twitter, sentiment analysis from that source might not fully capture the broader market trends or opinions. This could limit the overall perspective.\n3. **Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits**: StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment with 63.3% of users expressing positive views, supporting the overall positive sentiment from Reddit.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall sentiment score of approximately 0.942 and the bullish sentiment notes on both StockTwits and Reddit, the trading signal should be a **BUY**. This recommendation stems from:\n\n- Strong positive sentiment on Reddit and StockTwits.\n- High engagement and discussion levels on Reddit (85 posts analyzed).\n- A consistent bullish narrative across the main platforms.\n\nHowever, one should note the limited data on Twitter, indicating the need for caution and consideration of broader market factors when making trading decisions.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate an overall sentiment score based on the available data:\n\n- **Reddit Sentiment Score**: 0.978\n- **Twitter Sentiment Score**: 0.947\n- **StockTwits Sentiment Score**: 0.9\n\nTo find the average:\n\\[\n\\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.978 + 0.947 + 0.9)}{3} \\approx 0.94167\n\\]\n**Final Overall Sentiment Score**: **0.942** (rounded)\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nThe confidence levels from the sources are:\n- Reddit: High\n- Twitter: Medium\n- StockTwits: High\n\nGiven that Twitter has limited data (just 2 mentions), the overall confidence level is **Medium** based on the lower confidence from that source.\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince the sentiment scores across platforms are predominantly above 0.9 (highly positive), and the primary source (Reddit) has a high volume of posts with an even higher confidence level, we can categorize the sentiment trend as **Stable**.\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Positive Sentiment**: Reddit shows a very high average sentiment score of 0.978, indicating a strong positive perception about ETH among users, despite its dominant share of engagement.\n2. **Limited Twitter Feedback**: With only 2 mentions on Twitter, sentiment analysis from that source might not fully capture the broader market trends or opinions. This could limit the overall perspective.\n3. **Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits**: StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment with 63.3% of users expressing positive views, supporting the overall positive sentiment from Reddit.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall sentiment score of approximately 0.942 and the bullish sentiment notes on both StockTwits and Reddit, the trading signal should be a **BUY**. This recommendation stems from:\n\n- Strong positive sentiment on Reddit and StockTwits.\n- High engagement and discussion levels on Reddit (85 posts analyzed).\n- A consistent bullish narrative across the main platforms.\n\nHowever, one should note the limited data on Twitter, indicating the need for caution and consideration of broader market factors when making trading decisions.",

Confidence Level\nThe confidence levels from the sources are:\n- Reddit: High\n- Twitter: Medium\n- StockTwits: High\n\nGiven that Twitter has limited data (just 2 mentions), the overall confidence level is **Medium** based on the lower confidence from that source.\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince the sentiment scores across platforms are predominantly above 0.9 (highly positive), and the primary source (Reddit) has a high volume of posts with an even higher confidence level, we can categorize the sentiment trend as **Stable**.\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Positive Sentiment**: Reddit shows a very high average sentiment score of 0.978, indicating a strong positive perception about ETH among users, despite its dominant share of engagement.\n2. **Limited Twitter Feedback**: With only 2 mentions on Twitter, sentiment analysis from that source might not fully capture the broader market trends or opinions. This could limit the overall perspective.\n3. **Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits**: StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment with 63.3% of users expressing positive views, supporting the overall positive sentiment from Reddit.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall sentiment score of approximately 0.942 and the bullish sentiment notes on both StockTwits and Reddit, the trading signal should be a **BUY**. This recommendation stems from:\n\n- Strong positive sentiment on Reddit and StockTwits.\n- High engagement and discussion levels on Reddit (85 posts analyzed).\n- A consistent bullish narrative across the main platforms.\n\nHowever, one should note the limited data on Twitter, indicating the need for caution and consideration of broader market factors when making trading decisions.",
