Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform.

Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6.

Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend.

Health Overview\n- **Grade**: C- (Based on limited operating history as a public company and significant IPO volatility)\n- **Strengths**:\n  1. **Market Reception**: Strong first trading day, indicating investor interest and confidence.\n  2. **Capital Raised**: Successfully raised $1.2 billion, providing a significant capital injection.\n  3. **Revenue Growth Potential**: $821 million revenue suggests a strong market presence.\n- **Concerns**:\n  1. **Net Loss**: Reported net loss of $673.7 million indicates operational inefficiencies or substantial investment.\n  2. **High Volatility**: Significant stock price fluctuation shows market uncertainty.\n  3. **Negative P/E Ratio**: -76.39 indicates lack of profitability.\n- **Peer Rank**: Likely lower quartile in profitability compared to established SaaS companies due to net loss.\n\n### 2. Key Metrics\n| Category     | Current      | Industry     | Trend | Score |\n|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------|-------|\n| Profitability| -76.39 (P/E) | Positive     | \u2193     | 3     |\n| Liquidity    | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Leverage     | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Efficiency   | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n\n### 3. Income Statement\n- **Revenue**: $821 million in trailing twelve months prior to IPO.\n- **Margins**: Unspecified, but significant net loss indicates pressure on margins.\n- **Earnings**: Substantial net loss of $673.7 million suggests challenges with cost management or expansion investments.\n- **Costs**: Likely high due to reported losses; specifics not disclosed.\n\n### 4. Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Tianjin_SCO_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese developments underscore the dynamic nature of global trade and economic policies, which are crucial for informed trading decisions.\n\n\n## Key Economic Developments Impacting Global Markets:\n- [Donald Trump reignites global trade war with sweeping tariff regime](https://www.ft.com/content/f9cec1b0-9583-4791-9f18-164a30b13f9b?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31\n- [The Latest: US stock market and global trade partners react to Trump's new tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai), Published on Friday, August 01\n- [Asian shares fall as US unleashes fresh tariffs, jobs data up next](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31 ",

Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8.

Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Tianjin_SCO_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese developments underscore the dynamic nature of global trade and economic policies, which are crucial for informed trading decisions.\n\n\n## Key Economic Developments Impacting Global Markets:\n- [Donald Trump reignites global trade war with sweeping tariff regime](https://www.ft.com/content/f9cec1b0-9583-4791-9f18-164a30b13f9b?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31\n- [The Latest: US stock market and global trade partners react to Trump's new tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai), Published on Friday, August 01\n- [Asian shares fall as US unleashes fresh tariffs, jobs data up next](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31 ",

Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8.

Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Tianjin_SCO_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese developments underscore the dynamic nature of global trade and economic policies, which are crucial for informed trading decisions.\n\n\n## Key Economic Developments Impacting Global Markets:\n- [Donald Trump reignites global trade war with sweeping tariff regime](https://www.ft.com/content/f9cec1b0-9583-4791-9f18-164a30b13f9b?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31\n- [The Latest: US stock market and global trade partners react to Trump's new tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai), Published on Friday, August 01\n- [Asian shares fall as US unleashes fresh tariffs, jobs data up next](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31 ",

Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8.

Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries.

Health Overview\n- **Grade**: C- (Based on limited operating history as a public company and significant IPO volatility)\n- **Strengths**:\n  1. **Market Reception**: Strong first trading day, indicating investor interest and confidence.\n  2. **Capital Raised**: Successfully raised $1.2 billion, providing a significant capital injection.\n  3. **Revenue Growth Potential**: $821 million revenue suggests a strong market presence.\n- **Concerns**:\n  1. **Net Loss**: Reported net loss of $673.7 million indicates operational inefficiencies or substantial investment.\n  2. **High Volatility**: Significant stock price fluctuation shows market uncertainty.\n  3. **Negative P/E Ratio**: -76.39 indicates lack of profitability.\n- **Peer Rank**: Likely lower quartile in profitability compared to established SaaS companies due to net loss.\n\n### 2.

Income Statement\n- **Revenue**: $821 million in trailing twelve months prior to IPO.\n- **Margins**: Unspecified, but significant net loss indicates pressure on margins.\n- **Earnings**: Substantial net loss of $673.7 million suggests challenges with cost management or expansion investments.\n- **Costs**: Likely high due to reported losses; specifics not disclosed.\n\n### 4. Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Tianjin_SCO_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese developments underscore the dynamic nature of global trade and economic policies, which are crucial for informed trading decisions.\n\n\n## Key Economic Developments Impacting Global Markets:\n- [Donald Trump reignites global trade war with sweeping tariff regime](https://www.ft.com/content/f9cec1b0-9583-4791-9f18-164a30b13f9b?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31\n- [The Latest: US stock market and global trade partners react to Trump's new tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai), Published on Friday, August 01\n- [Asian shares fall as US unleashes fresh tariffs, jobs data up next](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31 ",

Key Metrics\n| Category     | Current      | Industry     | Trend | Score |\n|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------|-------|\n| Profitability| -76.39 (P/E) | Positive     | \u2193     | 3     |\n| Liquidity    | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Leverage     | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Efficiency   | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n\n### 3. Income Statement\n- **Revenue**: $821 million in trailing twelve months prior to IPO.\n- **Margins**: Unspecified, but significant net loss indicates pressure on margins.\n- **Earnings**: Substantial net loss of $673.7 million suggests challenges with cost management or expansion investments.\n- **Costs**: Likely high due to reported losses; specifics not disclosed.\n\n### 4. Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

For instance, a user mentioned:\n\n> \"I think functionally you're on the right track, but just as a matter of technicality it will be beneficial for you to kind of rethink one aspect... You shouldn't think of it as spent money, or money being returned, etc.\" ([memebergterminal.com](https://www.memebergterminal.com/stocks/fig?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, the Instagram account for Fig, a food discovery app, has been active, sharing content related to dietary restrictions and restaurant reviews.

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend.

([kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/ipos/figma-ipo-should-you-buy-fig-stock?utm_source=openai)) On its first trading day, FIG opened at $85, peaked at $124.63, and closed at $115.50, resulting in a market capitalization of $47.1 billion.

Health Overview\n- **Grade**: C- (Based on limited operating history as a public company and significant IPO volatility)\n- **Strengths**:\n  1. **Market Reception**: Strong first trading day, indicating investor interest and confidence.\n  2. **Capital Raised**: Successfully raised $1.2 billion, providing a significant capital injection.\n  3. **Revenue Growth Potential**: $821 million revenue suggests a strong market presence.\n- **Concerns**:\n  1. **Net Loss**: Reported net loss of $673.7 million indicates operational inefficiencies or substantial investment.\n  2. **High Volatility**: Significant stock price fluctuation shows market uncertainty.\n  3. **Negative P/E Ratio**: -76.39 indicates lack of profitability.\n- **Peer Rank**: Likely lower quartile in profitability compared to established SaaS companies due to net loss.\n\n### 2. Key Metrics\n| Category     | Current      | Industry     | Trend | Score |\n|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------|-------|\n| Profitability| -76.39 (P/E) | Positive     | \u2193     | 3     |\n| Liquidity    | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Leverage     | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Efficiency   | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n\n### 3. Income Statement\n- **Revenue**: $821 million in trailing twelve months prior to IPO.\n- **Margins**: Unspecified, but significant net loss indicates pressure on margins.\n- **Earnings**: Substantial net loss of $673.7 million suggests challenges with cost management or expansion investments.\n- **Costs**: Likely high due to reported losses; specifics not disclosed.\n\n### 4. Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend.

([kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/ipos/figma-ipo-should-you-buy-fig-stock?utm_source=openai)) On its first trading day, FIG opened at $85, peaked at $124.63, and closed at $115.50, resulting in a market capitalization of $47.1 billion.

Health Overview\n- **Grade**: C- (Based on limited operating history as a public company and significant IPO volatility)\n- **Strengths**:\n  1. **Market Reception**: Strong first trading day, indicating investor interest and confidence.\n  2. **Capital Raised**: Successfully raised $1.2 billion, providing a significant capital injection.\n  3. **Revenue Growth Potential**: $821 million revenue suggests a strong market presence.\n- **Concerns**:\n  1. **Net Loss**: Reported net loss of $673.7 million indicates operational inefficiencies or substantial investment.\n  2. **High Volatility**: Significant stock price fluctuation shows market uncertainty.\n  3. **Negative P/E Ratio**: -76.39 indicates lack of profitability.\n- **Peer Rank**: Likely lower quartile in profitability compared to established SaaS companies due to net loss.\n\n### 2. Key Metrics\n| Category     | Current      | Industry     | Trend | Score |\n|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------|-------|\n| Profitability| -76.39 (P/E) | Positive     | \u2193     | 3     |\n| Liquidity    | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Leverage     | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Efficiency   | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n\n### 3. Income Statement\n- **Revenue**: $821 million in trailing twelve months prior to IPO.\n- **Margins**: Unspecified, but significant net loss indicates pressure on margins.\n- **Earnings**: Substantial net loss of $673.7 million suggests challenges with cost management or expansion investments.\n- **Costs**: Likely high due to reported losses; specifics not disclosed.\n\n### 4. Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend.

([kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/ipos/figma-ipo-should-you-buy-fig-stock?utm_source=openai)) On its first trading day, FIG opened at $85, peaked at $124.63, and closed at $115.50, resulting in a market capitalization of $47.1 billion.

Health Overview\n- **Grade**: C- (Based on limited operating history as a public company and significant IPO volatility)\n- **Strengths**:\n  1. **Market Reception**: Strong first trading day, indicating investor interest and confidence.\n  2. **Capital Raised**: Successfully raised $1.2 billion, providing a significant capital injection.\n  3. **Revenue Growth Potential**: $821 million revenue suggests a strong market presence.\n- **Concerns**:\n  1. **Net Loss**: Reported net loss of $673.7 million indicates operational inefficiencies or substantial investment.\n  2. **High Volatility**: Significant stock price fluctuation shows market uncertainty.\n  3. **Negative P/E Ratio**: -76.39 indicates lack of profitability.\n- **Peer Rank**: Likely lower quartile in profitability compared to established SaaS companies due to net loss.\n\n### 2. Key Metrics\n| Category     | Current      | Industry     | Trend | Score |\n|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------|-------|\n| Profitability| -76.39 (P/E) | Positive     | \u2193     | 3     |\n| Liquidity    | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Leverage     | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Efficiency   | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n\n### 3. Income Statement\n- **Revenue**: $821 million in trailing twelve months prior to IPO.\n- **Margins**: Unspecified, but significant net loss indicates pressure on margins.\n- **Earnings**: Substantial net loss of $673.7 million suggests challenges with cost management or expansion investments.\n- **Costs**: Likely high due to reported losses; specifics not disclosed.\n\n### 4. Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend.

([kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/ipos/figma-ipo-should-you-buy-fig-stock?utm_source=openai)) On its first trading day, FIG opened at $85, peaked at $124.63, and closed at $115.50, resulting in a market capitalization of $47.1 billion.

Health Overview\n- **Grade**: C- (Based on limited operating history as a public company and significant IPO volatility)\n- **Strengths**:\n  1. **Market Reception**: Strong first trading day, indicating investor interest and confidence.\n  2. **Capital Raised**: Successfully raised $1.2 billion, providing a significant capital injection.\n  3. **Revenue Growth Potential**: $821 million revenue suggests a strong market presence.\n- **Concerns**:\n  1. **Net Loss**: Reported net loss of $673.7 million indicates operational inefficiencies or substantial investment.\n  2. **High Volatility**: Significant stock price fluctuation shows market uncertainty.\n  3. **Negative P/E Ratio**: -76.39 indicates lack of profitability.\n- **Peer Rank**: Likely lower quartile in profitability compared to established SaaS companies due to net loss.\n\n### 2. Key Metrics\n| Category     | Current      | Industry     | Trend | Score |\n|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------|-------|\n| Profitability| -76.39 (P/E) | Positive     | \u2193     | 3     |\n| Liquidity    | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Leverage     | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Efficiency   | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n\n### 3. Income Statement\n- **Revenue**: $821 million in trailing twelve months prior to IPO.\n- **Margins**: Unspecified, but significant net loss indicates pressure on margins.\n- **Earnings**: Substantial net loss of $673.7 million suggests challenges with cost management or expansion investments.\n- **Costs**: Likely high due to reported losses; specifics not disclosed.\n\n### 4. Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

For instance, a user mentioned:\n\n> \"I think functionally you're on the right track, but just as a matter of technicality it will be beneficial for you to kind of rethink one aspect... You shouldn't think of it as spent money, or money being returned, etc.\" ([memebergterminal.com](https://www.memebergterminal.com/stocks/fig?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, the Instagram account for Fig, a food discovery app, has been active, sharing content related to dietary restrictions and restaurant reviews.

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend.

Health Overview\n- **Grade**: C- (Based on limited operating history as a public company and significant IPO volatility)\n- **Strengths**:\n  1. **Market Reception**: Strong first trading day, indicating investor interest and confidence.\n  2. **Capital Raised**: Successfully raised $1.2 billion, providing a significant capital injection.\n  3. **Revenue Growth Potential**: $821 million revenue suggests a strong market presence.\n- **Concerns**:\n  1. **Net Loss**: Reported net loss of $673.7 million indicates operational inefficiencies or substantial investment.\n  2. **High Volatility**: Significant stock price fluctuation shows market uncertainty.\n  3. **Negative P/E Ratio**: -76.39 indicates lack of profitability.\n- **Peer Rank**: Likely lower quartile in profitability compared to established SaaS companies due to net loss.\n\n### 2. Key Metrics\n| Category     | Current      | Industry     | Trend | Score |\n|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------|-------|\n| Profitability| -76.39 (P/E) | Positive     | \u2193     | 3     |\n| Liquidity    | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Leverage     | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n| Efficiency   | N/A          | N/A          | \u2192     | N/A   |\n\n### 3. Income Statement\n- **Revenue**: $821 million in trailing twelve months prior to IPO.\n- **Margins**: Unspecified, but significant net loss indicates pressure on margins.\n- **Earnings**: Substantial net loss of $673.7 million suggests challenges with cost management or expansion investments.\n- **Costs**: Likely high due to reported losses; specifics not disclosed.\n\n### 4. Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend.

Balance Sheet\n- **Assets**: Information on specific assets not disclosed, but perspectives indicate investments including holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.\n- **Debt**: Not specified, but recent IPO suggests current capitalization mostly equity-driven.\n- **Working Capital**: Likely positive post-IPO, supported by $1.2 billion raised.\n- **Equity**: Notable equity increase following IPO capital influx.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow\n- **Operating**: Likely challenged given net losses; cash runway probably improved post-IPO.\n- **Free CF**: Difficult to determine without detailed capex data.\n- **Capital**: Recent capital inflow provides resources for growth and strategic investments.\n- **Position**: Improved liquidity thanks to IPO proceeds.\n\n### 6. Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Tianjin_SCO_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese developments underscore the dynamic nature of global trade and economic policies, which are crucial for informed trading decisions.\n\n\n## Key Economic Developments Impacting Global Markets:\n- [Donald Trump reignites global trade war with sweeping tariff regime](https://www.ft.com/content/f9cec1b0-9583-4791-9f18-164a30b13f9b?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31\n- [The Latest: US stock market and global trade partners react to Trump's new tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai), Published on Friday, August 01\n- [Asian shares fall as US unleashes fresh tariffs, jobs data up next](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31 ",

For instance, a user mentioned:\n\n> \"I think functionally you're on the right track, but just as a matter of technicality it will be beneficial for you to kind of rethink one aspect... You shouldn't think of it as spent money, or money being returned, etc.\" ([memebergterminal.com](https://www.memebergterminal.com/stocks/fig?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, the Instagram account for Fig, a food discovery app, has been active, sharing content related to dietary restrictions and restaurant reviews. Their Linktree provides access to various platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Tianjin_SCO_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese developments underscore the dynamic nature of global trade and economic policies, which are crucial for informed trading decisions.\n\n\n## Key Economic Developments Impacting Global Markets:\n- [Donald Trump reignites global trade war with sweeping tariff regime](https://www.ft.com/content/f9cec1b0-9583-4791-9f18-164a30b13f9b?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31\n- [The Latest: US stock market and global trade partners react to Trump's new tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai), Published on Friday, August 01\n- [Asian shares fall as US unleashes fresh tariffs, jobs data up next](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31 ",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Tianjin_SCO_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese developments underscore the dynamic nature of global trade and economic policies, which are crucial for informed trading decisions.\n\n\n## Key Economic Developments Impacting Global Markets:\n- [Donald Trump reignites global trade war with sweeping tariff regime](https://www.ft.com/content/f9cec1b0-9583-4791-9f18-164a30b13f9b?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31\n- [The Latest: US stock market and global trade partners react to Trump's new tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai), Published on Friday, August 01\n- [Asian shares fall as US unleashes fresh tariffs, jobs data up next](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31 ",

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend.

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform.

Valuation\n| Method | Current  | Target  | Upside | Confidence |\n|--------|----------|---------|--------|------------|\n| P/E    | -76.39   | N/A     | N/A    | Low        |\n| P/B    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| EV/EBITDA | N/A   | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n| DCF    | N/A      | N/A     | N/A    | N/A        |\n\n### 7. Growth & Risks\n- **Drivers**: New public listing, investor interest, and capital deployment in digital and crypto assets.\n- **Risks**: Continued net losses, stock volatility, strategic execution risks.\n- **Insider**: Unavailable, but IPO context suggests high initial investor activity.\n\n### 8. Investment Thesis\n- **Bull**: Rapid growth in digital collaboration tools post-IPO, potential for profitability on strategic evolution.\n- **Bear**: Sustained losses indicate prolonged path to profitability and potential market saturation risk.\n- **Base**: Await additional financial disclosures for clearer trajectory guidance.\n\nFigma's recent IPO and financial performance indicate potential, but the substantial losses and volatile market response suggest caution. Monitoring future financial disclosures and strategic initiatives will be crucial for a well-informed investment decision.",

For instance, a user mentioned:\n\n> \"I think functionally you're on the right track, but just as a matter of technicality it will be beneficial for you to kind of rethink one aspect... You shouldn't think of it as spent money, or money being returned, etc.\" ([memebergterminal.com](https://www.memebergterminal.com/stocks/fig?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, the Instagram account for Fig, a food discovery app, has been active, sharing content related to dietary restrictions and restaurant reviews. Their Linktree provides access to various platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.

Tariff rates ranged from 10% to 41%, with Canada facing a 35% duty and Taiwan a 20% duty. This move aims to address the U.S. trade deficit and protect national security. The announcement led to immediate market reactions:\n\n- **U.S. Stock Market:** Major indices experienced sharp declines, marking the worst day since May. Investors expressed concerns over potential job market weakening and increased inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Asian Markets:** The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell by 0.7%, with South Korea and Taiwan markets declining by 3% and 0.9%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei edged down by 0.4%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Global Trade Relations and Economic Indicators**\n\n- **European Union:** The U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, imposing a 15% tariff on European imports. Steel and aluminum trade will proceed through a quota system with minimal or no tariffs, aiming to counter subsidized metal exports from China. ([newlinesinstitute.org](https://newlinesinstitute.org/forecast/week-20250801/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China:** Policymakers are cautiously reducing stimulus measures. Upcoming trade and inflation data will provide insights into the challenges of transitioning to a consumer-based economy amid limited new measures from the Politburo. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-graphic-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Germany:** The German Parliament approved a constitutional amendment to remove the \"debt brake,\" allowing for increased government borrowing. This paves the way for a proposed \u20ac500 billion infrastructure investment over the next 12 years and \u20ac400 billion in additional defense spending. The implementation of this program could positively impact growth in Germany and other European countries. ([www2.deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-outlook/weekly-update/weekly-update-2025-03.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Upcoming Economic Events**\n\n- **2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit:** Scheduled for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The summit will focus on global economic cooperation, with South Africa advocating for the development of African economies and global debt reform. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_G20_Johannesburg_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit:** Set for August 31 to September 1, 2025, in Tianjin, China. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit will address regional security and economic issues, with leaders from member countries expected to attend. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Tianjin_SCO_summit?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese developments underscore the dynamic nature of global trade and economic policies, which are crucial for informed trading decisions.\n\n\n## Key Economic Developments Impacting Global Markets:\n- [Donald Trump reignites global trade war with sweeping tariff regime](https://www.ft.com/content/f9cec1b0-9583-4791-9f18-164a30b13f9b?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31\n- [The Latest: US stock market and global trade partners react to Trump's new tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/4e96e1d0a3e4f41cc4772d3fb4dc80af?utm_source=openai), Published on Friday, August 01\n- [Asian shares fall as US unleashes fresh tariffs, jobs data up next](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-2-2025-08-01/?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, July 31 ",
