Confidence Level\nGiven that data is available from only two out of three platforms (Reddit and StockTwits), the confidence level should be adjusted accordingly. Both sources have high confidence individually, but due to the limited data set:\n- **Confidence Level:** Medium\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nThe sentiment scores show strong positivity from both platforms, indicating stability in positive sentiment:\n- **Sentiment Trend:** Stable\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Positive Sentiment:** The sentiment on both Reddit (0.987) and StockTwits (0.833) is distinctly positive. This indicates a favorable view of UNH among social media users.\n2. **High Engagement on Reddit:** The average comments on Reddit (89.83) show a high level of engagement, suggesting that discussions around UNH are active and likely influential among retail investors and analysts.\n3. **Limited Twitter Data:** Twitter data is unavailable, meaning insights may be missing from that social platform, potentially affecting the overall market sentiment.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall positive sentiment combined with high engagement on Reddit:\n- **Trading Signal:** BUY\n- **Rationale:** The combined sentiment scores from Reddit and StockTwits indicate strong bullish sentiment, and the high engagement levels on Reddit suggest that the positive sentiment is actively discussed and potentially shared among a wider audience, leading to a favorable trading outlook for UNH.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while the sentiment towards UNH is overwhelmingly positive based on Reddit and StockTwits, the absence of Twitter data limits the full spectrum of analysis. The trading signal leans towards a BUY based on the current positive outlook and engagement metrics.",

Confidence Level\nGiven that data is available from only two out of three platforms (Reddit and StockTwits), the confidence level should be adjusted accordingly.

Sentiment Trend\nThe sentiment scores show strong positivity from both platforms, indicating stability in positive sentiment:\n- **Sentiment Trend:** Stable\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Positive Sentiment:** The sentiment on both Reddit (0.987) and StockTwits (0.833) is distinctly positive. This indicates a favorable view of UNH among social media users.\n2. **High Engagement on Reddit:** The average comments on Reddit (89.83) show a high level of engagement, suggesting that discussions around UNH are active and likely influential among retail investors and analysts.\n3. **Limited Twitter Data:** Twitter data is unavailable, meaning insights may be missing from that social platform, potentially affecting the overall market sentiment.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall positive sentiment combined with high engagement on Reddit:\n- **Trading Signal:** BUY\n- **Rationale:** The combined sentiment scores from Reddit and StockTwits indicate strong bullish sentiment, and the high engagement levels on Reddit suggest that the positive sentiment is actively discussed and potentially shared among a wider audience, leading to a favorable trading outlook for UNH.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while the sentiment towards UNH is overwhelmingly positive based on Reddit and StockTwits, the absence of Twitter data limits the full spectrum of analysis. The trading signal leans towards a BUY based on the current positive outlook and engagement metrics.",

Confidence Level\nGiven that data is available from only two out of three platforms (Reddit and StockTwits), the confidence level should be adjusted accordingly. Both sources have high confidence individually, but due to the limited data set:\n- **Confidence Level:** Medium\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nThe sentiment scores show strong positivity from both platforms, indicating stability in positive sentiment:\n- **Sentiment Trend:** Stable\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Positive Sentiment:** The sentiment on both Reddit (0.987) and StockTwits (0.833) is distinctly positive. This indicates a favorable view of UNH among social media users.\n2. **High Engagement on Reddit:** The average comments on Reddit (89.83) show a high level of engagement, suggesting that discussions around UNH are active and likely influential among retail investors and analysts.\n3. **Limited Twitter Data:** Twitter data is unavailable, meaning insights may be missing from that social platform, potentially affecting the overall market sentiment.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall positive sentiment combined with high engagement on Reddit:\n- **Trading Signal:** BUY\n- **Rationale:** The combined sentiment scores from Reddit and StockTwits indicate strong bullish sentiment, and the high engagement levels on Reddit suggest that the positive sentiment is actively discussed and potentially shared among a wider audience, leading to a favorable trading outlook for UNH.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while the sentiment towards UNH is overwhelmingly positive based on Reddit and StockTwits, the absence of Twitter data limits the full spectrum of analysis. The trading signal leans towards a BUY based on the current positive outlook and engagement metrics.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score based solely on available data:\n\n- **Reddit Sentiment Score:** 0.987\n- **StockTwits Sentiment Score:** 0.833 (with a bullish sentiment)\n\nTo combine these scores in a meaningful way, we can take an average of the available sentiment scores:\n\\[\n\\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.987 + 0.833)}{2} = 0.910\n\\]\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nGiven that data is available from only two out of three platforms (Reddit and StockTwits), the confidence level should be adjusted accordingly. Both sources have high confidence individually, but due to the limited data set:\n- **Confidence Level:** Medium\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nThe sentiment scores show strong positivity from both platforms, indicating stability in positive sentiment:\n- **Sentiment Trend:** Stable\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Positive Sentiment:** The sentiment on both Reddit (0.987) and StockTwits (0.833) is distinctly positive. This indicates a favorable view of UNH among social media users.\n2. **High Engagement on Reddit:** The average comments on Reddit (89.83) show a high level of engagement, suggesting that discussions around UNH are active and likely influential among retail investors and analysts.\n3. **Limited Twitter Data:** Twitter data is unavailable, meaning insights may be missing from that social platform, potentially affecting the overall market sentiment.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall positive sentiment combined with high engagement on Reddit:\n- **Trading Signal:** BUY\n- **Rationale:** The combined sentiment scores from Reddit and StockTwits indicate strong bullish sentiment, and the high engagement levels on Reddit suggest that the positive sentiment is actively discussed and potentially shared among a wider audience, leading to a favorable trading outlook for UNH.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while the sentiment towards UNH is overwhelmingly positive based on Reddit and StockTwits, the absence of Twitter data limits the full spectrum of analysis. The trading signal leans towards a BUY based on the current positive outlook and engagement metrics.",

Sentiment Trend\nThe sentiment scores show strong positivity from both platforms, indicating stability in positive sentiment:\n- **Sentiment Trend:** Stable\n\n#### 4.

This indicates a favorable view of UNH among social media users.\n2. **High Engagement on Reddit:** The average comments on Reddit (89.83) show a high level of engagement, suggesting that discussions around UNH are active and likely influential among retail investors and analysts.\n3. **Limited Twitter Data:** Twitter data is unavailable, meaning insights may be missing from that social platform, potentially affecting the overall market sentiment.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall positive sentiment combined with high engagement on Reddit:\n- **Trading Signal:** BUY\n- **Rationale:** The combined sentiment scores from Reddit and StockTwits indicate strong bullish sentiment, and the high engagement levels on Reddit suggest that the positive sentiment is actively discussed and potentially shared among a wider audience, leading to a favorable trading outlook for UNH.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while the sentiment towards UNH is overwhelmingly positive based on Reddit and StockTwits, the absence of Twitter data limits the full spectrum of analysis.

Confidence Level\nGiven that data is available from only two out of three platforms (Reddit and StockTwits), the confidence level should be adjusted accordingly. Both sources have high confidence individually, but due to the limited data set:\n- **Confidence Level:** Medium\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nThe sentiment scores show strong positivity from both platforms, indicating stability in positive sentiment:\n- **Sentiment Trend:** Stable\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Positive Sentiment:** The sentiment on both Reddit (0.987) and StockTwits (0.833) is distinctly positive. This indicates a favorable view of UNH among social media users.\n2. **High Engagement on Reddit:** The average comments on Reddit (89.83) show a high level of engagement, suggesting that discussions around UNH are active and likely influential among retail investors and analysts.\n3. **Limited Twitter Data:** Twitter data is unavailable, meaning insights may be missing from that social platform, potentially affecting the overall market sentiment.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall positive sentiment combined with high engagement on Reddit:\n- **Trading Signal:** BUY\n- **Rationale:** The combined sentiment scores from Reddit and StockTwits indicate strong bullish sentiment, and the high engagement levels on Reddit suggest that the positive sentiment is actively discussed and potentially shared among a wider audience, leading to a favorable trading outlook for UNH.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while the sentiment towards UNH is overwhelmingly positive based on Reddit and StockTwits, the absence of Twitter data limits the full spectrum of analysis. The trading signal leans towards a BUY based on the current positive outlook and engagement metrics.",

Confidence Level\nGiven that data is available from only two out of three platforms (Reddit and StockTwits), the confidence level should be adjusted accordingly. Both sources have high confidence individually, but due to the limited data set:\n- **Confidence Level:** Medium\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nThe sentiment scores show strong positivity from both platforms, indicating stability in positive sentiment:\n- **Sentiment Trend:** Stable\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Positive Sentiment:** The sentiment on both Reddit (0.987) and StockTwits (0.833) is distinctly positive. This indicates a favorable view of UNH among social media users.\n2. **High Engagement on Reddit:** The average comments on Reddit (89.83) show a high level of engagement, suggesting that discussions around UNH are active and likely influential among retail investors and analysts.\n3. **Limited Twitter Data:** Twitter data is unavailable, meaning insights may be missing from that social platform, potentially affecting the overall market sentiment.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nGiven the overall positive sentiment combined with high engagement on Reddit:\n- **Trading Signal:** BUY\n- **Rationale:** The combined sentiment scores from Reddit and StockTwits indicate strong bullish sentiment, and the high engagement levels on Reddit suggest that the positive sentiment is actively discussed and potentially shared among a wider audience, leading to a favorable trading outlook for UNH.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while the sentiment towards UNH is overwhelmingly positive based on Reddit and StockTwits, the absence of Twitter data limits the full spectrum of analysis. The trading signal leans towards a BUY based on the current positive outlook and engagement metrics.",
