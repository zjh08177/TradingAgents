Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

                "content": "### Social Media Analysis for TSLA\n\n**1. Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

                "content": "### Social Media Analysis for TSLA\n\n**1. Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

                "content": "### Social Media Analysis for TSLA\n\n**1. Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

                "content": "### Social Media Analysis for TSLA\n\n**1. Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

                "content": "### Social Media Analysis for TSLA\n\n**1. Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",

Overall Sentiment Score:**  \n- Overall sentiment is primarily derived from Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits. \n- **Reddit** has a strong positive sentiment score of **0.986**, indicating bullish outlook among users.\n- **Twitter** shows a **neutral** sentiment score of **0.461**, suggesting users are not firmly in either bullish or bearish camp.\n- **StockTwits** has a slightly negative sentiment score of **-0.067**, indicating some bearish sentiments but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nTo calculate a composite sentiment score, given the confidence levels and the number of mentions/messages:\n- Reddit (weight factor: 0.5) = 0.986 * 0.5 = 0.493\n- Twitter (weight factor: 0.25) = 0.461 * 0.25 = 0.11525\n- StockTwits (weight factor: 0.25) = -0.067 * 0.25 = -0.01675\n\n**Composite Sentiment Score = 0.493 + 0.11525 - 0.01675 = 0.5915**  \nTherefore, the overall sentiment score is approximately **0.59**.\n\n**2. Confidence Level:**  \nThe confidence level must consider the varied quality and quantity of the data across platforms. While Reddit has high confidence due to strong sentiment and engagement metrics, both Twitter and StockTwits feature medium to high confidence, but with limited activity.  \nThus, the adjusted confidence level is **Medium** due to the reliance on fewer mentions in Twitter and StockTwits.\n\n**3. Sentiment Trend:**  \nGiven that Reddit sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and dominates the analysis, while Twitter is neutral and StockTwits leans slightly negative but is not significantly bearish, the general sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. The positive Reddit posts provide a counterbalance to the neutrals and negatives from the other platforms.\n\n**4. Top 3 Key Insights:**\n- **Strong Positive Sentiment on Reddit:** The highest engagement metrics (average score of 159.84 and average comments of 42.72) showcase an active and optimistic community regarding TSLA.\n- **Low Engagement on Twitter and Mixed Sentiment on StockTwits:** With only 2 mentions on Twitter and a neutral sentiment score, it points to limited discourse there. StockTwits showed a slight bearish disposition, which may highlight concerns among some traders.\n- **Data Limitations:** While Reddit offers a strong sentiment, Twitter's minimal mentions and the lack of robust bearish sentiment on StockTwits indicate that the analysis might not capture the full spectrum of market sentiment, particularly among day traders who frequently use these platforms.\n\n**5. Trading Signal:**  \n**Recommendation: BUY**  \n**Rationale:** The strong positive sentiment from Reddit combined with a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment in Twitter and StockTwits suggests a solid base of bullish sentiment. The high engagement on Reddit indicates active investor interest and potentially positive market movements ahead, whereas the negative sentiment on StockTwits is not overwhelmingly strong enough to counteract the positivity felt in Reddit. Given the overall sentiment score of 0.59 and the confidence in Reddit's data, a buy signal is justified. \n\n**Conclusion:** Although data limitations exist, particularly due to low mention counts on Twitter and mixed sentiments on StockTwits, the prevailing positive attitude in the dominant Reddit discussions prompts a recommendation to buy TSLA.",
