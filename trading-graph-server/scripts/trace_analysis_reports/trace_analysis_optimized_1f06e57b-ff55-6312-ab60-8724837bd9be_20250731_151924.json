            "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026. ([mediacenter.imf.org](https://mediacenter.imf.org/news/imf---world-economic-outlook-july-2025/s/c7789a59-7b0e-4158-a2df-cb96b75b7bd5?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026. ([mediacenter.imf.org](https://mediacenter.imf.org/news/imf---world-economic-outlook-july-2025/s/c7789a59-7b0e-4158-a2df-cb96b75b7bd5?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions.

IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026.

U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026.

U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026. ([mediacenter.imf.org](https://mediacenter.imf.org/news/imf---world-economic-outlook-july-2025/s/c7789a59-7b0e-4158-a2df-cb96b75b7bd5?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026. ([mediacenter.imf.org](https://mediacenter.imf.org/news/imf---world-economic-outlook-july-2025/s/c7789a59-7b0e-4158-a2df-cb96b75b7bd5?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026. ([mediacenter.imf.org](https://mediacenter.imf.org/news/imf---world-economic-outlook-july-2025/s/c7789a59-7b0e-4158-a2df-cb96b75b7bd5?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026. ([mediacenter.imf.org](https://mediacenter.imf.org/news/imf---world-economic-outlook-july-2025/s/c7789a59-7b0e-4158-a2df-cb96b75b7bd5?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026.

U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026. ([mediacenter.imf.org](https://mediacenter.imf.org/news/imf---world-economic-outlook-july-2025/s/c7789a59-7b0e-4158-a2df-cb96b75b7bd5?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026. ([mediacenter.imf.org](https://mediacenter.imf.org/news/imf---world-economic-outlook-july-2025/s/c7789a59-7b0e-4158-a2df-cb96b75b7bd5?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026.

U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026.

U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026.

U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026. ([mediacenter.imf.org](https://mediacenter.imf.org/news/imf---world-economic-outlook-july-2025/s/c7789a59-7b0e-4158-a2df-cb96b75b7bd5?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026.

U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026.

U.S. and Chinese Trade Negotiations**\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials began a second day of talks in Stockholm on July 29, 2025, aiming to resolve economic disputes and de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence global trade dynamics and market sentiment. ([intercamblog.com](https://intercamblog.com/daily-brief-july-29-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows**\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in June 2025, decreasing by 10.8% year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a decline in imports and a modest increase in exports, indicating a potential strengthening of the U.S. economy.

                "content": "Between July 23 and July 30, 2025, several macroeconomic developments have emerged that are pertinent for trading decisions:\n\n**1. Brazil's Monetary Policy Decision**\n\nOn July 30, 2025, Brazil's central bank (Copom) paused its aggressive monetary tightening cycle, maintaining the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% after seven consecutive hikes. This decision reflects the bank's intent to assess the cumulative impact of previous rate increases and determine if a prolonged hold could guide inflation back to target. The bank remains cautious amid rising global uncertainty, especially due to a new 50% U.S. tariff affecting Brazilian exports, and refrains from signaling a timeline for future rate cuts. Inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at 4.9% and 3.6%, respectively. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-pauses-rate-hikes-signals-prolonged-hold-eyeing-us-tariffs-2025-07-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. U.S. Imposes Tariffs on India**\n\nOn July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 1, 2025. Despite this blow to India\u2019s trade, the country may still remain a viable alternative in the \"China-plus-one\" strategy for global manufacturers like Apple, aiming to reduce supply chain dependence on China. India's large domestic market and lower exposure to China still make it attractive to companies reassessing supply chains. However, India's significant trade relationship with Russia, especially in energy and defense, might attract further U.S. sanctions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-tariff-keeps-india-china-plus-one-now-2025-07-31/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. IMF Updates Global Growth Forecasts**\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections, forecasting a 3.0% growth rate for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading, lower tariff rates compared to early April, easier financial conditions, including a weaker U.S. dollar, and fiscal expansion in some jurisdictions. However, projections remain about 0.2 percentage points below pre-April forecasts, indicating that trade tensions are still impacting the global economy. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.2% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026.
