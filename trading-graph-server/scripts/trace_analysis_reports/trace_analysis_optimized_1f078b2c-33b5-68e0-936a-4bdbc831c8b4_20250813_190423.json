Overall Sentiment Score:\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score based on available data:\n- **Reddit Sentiment Score:** 0.986\n- **Twitter Sentiment Score:** 0.994\n- **StockTwits Sentiment Score:** 1.0\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score** = (0.986 + 0.994 + 1.0) / 3 = **0.993** (rounded for clarity)\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level:\nGiven the distribution and quality of the data collected:\n- **Reddit:** High confidence with 22 posts analyzed.\n- **Twitter:** Medium confidence with only 2 mentions.\n- **StockTwits:** High confidence with 30 messages.\n\n**Adjusted Confidence Level** = Based on the lack of Twitter data, the overall confidence level will be considered **Medium**.\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend:\nWhile we don't have historical data to explicitly define a trend, the consistently high sentiment scores across Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits imply a **Stable** sentiment trend, characterized by bullish sentiments across all platforms.\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights:\n1. **Strong Sentiment Across Platforms:** The sentiment scores are notably high on Reddit (0.986), Twitter (0.994), and StockTwits (1.0), indicating a positive perception of UNH among investors.\n2. **Limited Twitter Data:** Only 2 mentions from Twitter provide a narrower view compared to the larger datasets from Reddit and StockTwits, which may limit overall sentiment comprehensiveness.\n3. **Bullish Indicators:** StockTwits data shows a significant bullish percentage (43.3%) with no bearish sentiment recorded (0.0%), reinforcing confidence in a positive outlook among investors.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal:\nBased on the overall sentiment score, positive sentiment trends, and substantial supportive insights from Reddit and StockTwits:\n\n**Trading Signal:** **BUY**\n\n**Rationale:** The consistently high sentiment scores and bullish indicators suggest that investor sentiment is largely positive towards UNH.
