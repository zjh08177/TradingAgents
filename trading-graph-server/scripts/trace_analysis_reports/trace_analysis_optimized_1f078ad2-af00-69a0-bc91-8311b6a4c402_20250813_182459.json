Confidence Level\n- **Twitter Confidence:** Low\n- **StockTwits Confidence:** High\n- **Reddit Confidence:** Low\n\nGiven the high confidence from StockTwits in its strong bullish sentiment, and the low confidence from Twitter, the overall confidence level is primarily dictated by StockTwits.\n\n**Confidence Level:** **Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\n- Twitter is trending positively (bullish).\n- StockTwits sentiment is strongly bullish.\n- Reddit does not provide sufficient activity or sentiment influence due to lack of posts.\n\nSince the majority bullish sentiment from StockTwits and Twitter aligns positively, it indicates an upward trend.\n\n**Sentiment Trend:** **Rising**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits:** With a sentiment score of 1.0 and 63.3% of the messages being bullish, StockTwits indicates a solid positive outlook for CAI.\n  \n2. **Low Engagement on Reddit:** There were no posts analyzed on Reddit, suggesting either a lack of discussion around CAI or potential underperformance in this community, which may limit sentiment analysis from that platform.\n\n3. **Positive Mentions on Twitter:** While the sentiment score on Twitter is lower at 0.635, the number of mentions (24) indicates active discussions, although with a lower confidence level.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nBased on the high overall sentiment score (0.84) and the bullish sentiment from both StockTwits and Twitter, combined with a rising trend, the recommendation would be to take a bullish position.\n\n**Trading Signal:** **BUY**\n\n**Rationale:** The decisive bullish sentiment from StockTwits (which has high confidence) and the active discussions on Twitter suggest that investors are optimistic about CAI's performance. The sentiment trend is rising, indicating potential for further positive movement in the stock price.",

Confidence Level\n- **Twitter Confidence:** Low\n- **StockTwits Confidence:** High\n- **Reddit Confidence:** Low\n\nGiven the high confidence from StockTwits in its strong bullish sentiment, and the low confidence from Twitter, the overall confidence level is primarily dictated by StockTwits.\n\n**Confidence Level:** **Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\n- Twitter is trending positively (bullish).\n- StockTwits sentiment is strongly bullish.\n- Reddit does not provide sufficient activity or sentiment influence due to lack of posts.\n\nSince the majority bullish sentiment from StockTwits and Twitter aligns positively, it indicates an upward trend.\n\n**Sentiment Trend:** **Rising**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits:** With a sentiment score of 1.0 and 63.3% of the messages being bullish, StockTwits indicates a solid positive outlook for CAI.\n  \n2. **Low Engagement on Reddit:** There were no posts analyzed on Reddit, suggesting either a lack of discussion around CAI or potential underperformance in this community, which may limit sentiment analysis from that platform.\n\n3. **Positive Mentions on Twitter:** While the sentiment score on Twitter is lower at 0.635, the number of mentions (24) indicates active discussions, although with a lower confidence level.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nBased on the high overall sentiment score (0.84) and the bullish sentiment from both StockTwits and Twitter, combined with a rising trend, the recommendation would be to take a bullish position.\n\n**Trading Signal:** **BUY**\n\n**Rationale:** The decisive bullish sentiment from StockTwits (which has high confidence) and the active discussions on Twitter suggest that investors are optimistic about CAI's performance. The sentiment trend is rising, indicating potential for further positive movement in the stock price.",

Confidence Level\n- **Twitter Confidence:** Low\n- **StockTwits Confidence:** High\n- **Reddit Confidence:** Low\n\nGiven the high confidence from StockTwits in its strong bullish sentiment, and the low confidence from Twitter, the overall confidence level is primarily dictated by StockTwits.\n\n**Confidence Level:** **Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\n- Twitter is trending positively (bullish).\n- StockTwits sentiment is strongly bullish.\n- Reddit does not provide sufficient activity or sentiment influence due to lack of posts.\n\nSince the majority bullish sentiment from StockTwits and Twitter aligns positively, it indicates an upward trend.\n\n**Sentiment Trend:** **Rising**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits:** With a sentiment score of 1.0 and 63.3% of the messages being bullish, StockTwits indicates a solid positive outlook for CAI.\n  \n2. **Low Engagement on Reddit:** There were no posts analyzed on Reddit, suggesting either a lack of discussion around CAI or potential underperformance in this community, which may limit sentiment analysis from that platform.\n\n3. **Positive Mentions on Twitter:** While the sentiment score on Twitter is lower at 0.635, the number of mentions (24) indicates active discussions, although with a lower confidence level.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nBased on the high overall sentiment score (0.84) and the bullish sentiment from both StockTwits and Twitter, combined with a rising trend, the recommendation would be to take a bullish position.\n\n**Trading Signal:** **BUY**\n\n**Rationale:** The decisive bullish sentiment from StockTwits (which has high confidence) and the active discussions on Twitter suggest that investors are optimistic about CAI's performance.

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will consider the scores from all three platforms. \n\n- **Twitter Sentiment Score:** 0.635 (bullish)\n- **StockTwits Sentiment Score:** 1.0 (bullish)\n- **Reddit Sentiment Score:** 0.5 (neutral)\n\nGiven the weight of the inputs, the overall sentiment score can be approximated by averaging the scores weighted by the number of mentions/messages:\n\n(0.635 (Twitter) * 24 + 1.0 (StockTwits) * 30 + 0.5 (Reddit) * 0) / (24 + 30 + 0) = (15.24 + 30 + 0) / 54 = 0.840\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score:** **0.84**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\n- **Twitter Confidence:** Low\n- **StockTwits Confidence:** High\n- **Reddit Confidence:** Low\n\nGiven the high confidence from StockTwits in its strong bullish sentiment, and the low confidence from Twitter, the overall confidence level is primarily dictated by StockTwits.\n\n**Confidence Level:** **Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\n- Twitter is trending positively (bullish).\n- StockTwits sentiment is strongly bullish.\n- Reddit does not provide sufficient activity or sentiment influence due to lack of posts.\n\nSince the majority bullish sentiment from StockTwits and Twitter aligns positively, it indicates an upward trend.\n\n**Sentiment Trend:** **Rising**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits:** With a sentiment score of 1.0 and 63.3% of the messages being bullish, StockTwits indicates a solid positive outlook for CAI.\n  \n2. **Low Engagement on Reddit:** There were no posts analyzed on Reddit, suggesting either a lack of discussion around CAI or potential underperformance in this community, which may limit sentiment analysis from that platform.\n\n3. **Positive Mentions on Twitter:** While the sentiment score on Twitter is lower at 0.635, the number of mentions (24) indicates active discussions, although with a lower confidence level.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nBased on the high overall sentiment score (0.84) and the bullish sentiment from both StockTwits and Twitter, combined with a rising trend, the recommendation would be to take a bullish position.\n\n**Trading Signal:** **BUY**\n\n**Rationale:** The decisive bullish sentiment from StockTwits (which has high confidence) and the active discussions on Twitter suggest that investors are optimistic about CAI's performance. The sentiment trend is rising, indicating potential for further positive movement in the stock price.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will consider the scores from all three platforms. \n\n- **Twitter Sentiment Score:** 0.635 (bullish)\n- **StockTwits Sentiment Score:** 1.0 (bullish)\n- **Reddit Sentiment Score:** 0.5 (neutral)\n\nGiven the weight of the inputs, the overall sentiment score can be approximated by averaging the scores weighted by the number of mentions/messages:\n\n(0.635 (Twitter) * 24 + 1.0 (StockTwits) * 30 + 0.5 (Reddit) * 0) / (24 + 30 + 0) = (15.24 + 30 + 0) / 54 = 0.840\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score:** **0.84**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\n- **Twitter Confidence:** Low\n- **StockTwits Confidence:** High\n- **Reddit Confidence:** Low\n\nGiven the high confidence from StockTwits in its strong bullish sentiment, and the low confidence from Twitter, the overall confidence level is primarily dictated by StockTwits.\n\n**Confidence Level:** **Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\n- Twitter is trending positively (bullish).\n- StockTwits sentiment is strongly bullish.\n- Reddit does not provide sufficient activity or sentiment influence due to lack of posts.\n\nSince the majority bullish sentiment from StockTwits and Twitter aligns positively, it indicates an upward trend.\n\n**Sentiment Trend:** **Rising**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits:** With a sentiment score of 1.0 and 63.3% of the messages being bullish, StockTwits indicates a solid positive outlook for CAI.\n  \n2. **Low Engagement on Reddit:** There were no posts analyzed on Reddit, suggesting either a lack of discussion around CAI or potential underperformance in this community, which may limit sentiment analysis from that platform.\n\n3. **Positive Mentions on Twitter:** While the sentiment score on Twitter is lower at 0.635, the number of mentions (24) indicates active discussions, although with a lower confidence level.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nBased on the high overall sentiment score (0.84) and the bullish sentiment from both StockTwits and Twitter, combined with a rising trend, the recommendation would be to take a bullish position.\n\n**Trading Signal:** **BUY**\n\n**Rationale:** The decisive bullish sentiment from StockTwits (which has high confidence) and the active discussions on Twitter suggest that investors are optimistic about CAI's performance. The sentiment trend is rising, indicating potential for further positive movement in the stock price.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will consider the scores from all three platforms. \n\n- **Twitter Sentiment Score:** 0.635 (bullish)\n- **StockTwits Sentiment Score:** 1.0 (bullish)\n- **Reddit Sentiment Score:** 0.5 (neutral)\n\nGiven the weight of the inputs, the overall sentiment score can be approximated by averaging the scores weighted by the number of mentions/messages:\n\n(0.635 (Twitter) * 24 + 1.0 (StockTwits) * 30 + 0.5 (Reddit) * 0) / (24 + 30 + 0) = (15.24 + 30 + 0) / 54 = 0.840\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score:** **0.84**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\n- **Twitter Confidence:** Low\n- **StockTwits Confidence:** High\n- **Reddit Confidence:** Low\n\nGiven the high confidence from StockTwits in its strong bullish sentiment, and the low confidence from Twitter, the overall confidence level is primarily dictated by StockTwits.\n\n**Confidence Level:** **Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\n- Twitter is trending positively (bullish).\n- StockTwits sentiment is strongly bullish.\n- Reddit does not provide sufficient activity or sentiment influence due to lack of posts.\n\nSince the majority bullish sentiment from StockTwits and Twitter aligns positively, it indicates an upward trend.\n\n**Sentiment Trend:** **Rising**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits:** With a sentiment score of 1.0 and 63.3% of the messages being bullish, StockTwits indicates a solid positive outlook for CAI.\n  \n2. **Low Engagement on Reddit:** There were no posts analyzed on Reddit, suggesting either a lack of discussion around CAI or potential underperformance in this community, which may limit sentiment analysis from that platform.\n\n3. **Positive Mentions on Twitter:** While the sentiment score on Twitter is lower at 0.635, the number of mentions (24) indicates active discussions, although with a lower confidence level.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nBased on the high overall sentiment score (0.84) and the bullish sentiment from both StockTwits and Twitter, combined with a rising trend, the recommendation would be to take a bullish position.\n\n**Trading Signal:** **BUY**\n\n**Rationale:** The decisive bullish sentiment from StockTwits (which has high confidence) and the active discussions on Twitter suggest that investors are optimistic about CAI's performance. The sentiment trend is rising, indicating potential for further positive movement in the stock price.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will consider the scores from all three platforms. \n\n- **Twitter Sentiment Score:** 0.635 (bullish)\n- **StockTwits Sentiment Score:** 1.0 (bullish)\n- **Reddit Sentiment Score:** 0.5 (neutral)\n\nGiven the weight of the inputs, the overall sentiment score can be approximated by averaging the scores weighted by the number of mentions/messages:\n\n(0.635 (Twitter) * 24 + 1.0 (StockTwits) * 30 + 0.5 (Reddit) * 0) / (24 + 30 + 0) = (15.24 + 30 + 0) / 54 = 0.840\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score:** **0.84**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\n- **Twitter Confidence:** Low\n- **StockTwits Confidence:** High\n- **Reddit Confidence:** Low\n\nGiven the high confidence from StockTwits in its strong bullish sentiment, and the low confidence from Twitter, the overall confidence level is primarily dictated by StockTwits.\n\n**Confidence Level:** **Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\n- Twitter is trending positively (bullish).\n- StockTwits sentiment is strongly bullish.\n- Reddit does not provide sufficient activity or sentiment influence due to lack of posts.\n\nSince the majority bullish sentiment from StockTwits and Twitter aligns positively, it indicates an upward trend.\n\n**Sentiment Trend:** **Rising**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits:** With a sentiment score of 1.0 and 63.3% of the messages being bullish, StockTwits indicates a solid positive outlook for CAI.\n  \n2. **Low Engagement on Reddit:** There were no posts analyzed on Reddit, suggesting either a lack of discussion around CAI or potential underperformance in this community, which may limit sentiment analysis from that platform.\n\n3. **Positive Mentions on Twitter:** While the sentiment score on Twitter is lower at 0.635, the number of mentions (24) indicates active discussions, although with a lower confidence level.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nBased on the high overall sentiment score (0.84) and the bullish sentiment from both StockTwits and Twitter, combined with a rising trend, the recommendation would be to take a bullish position.\n\n**Trading Signal:** **BUY**\n\n**Rationale:** The decisive bullish sentiment from StockTwits (which has high confidence) and the active discussions on Twitter suggest that investors are optimistic about CAI's performance. The sentiment trend is rising, indicating potential for further positive movement in the stock price.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will consider the scores from all three platforms. \n\n- **Twitter Sentiment Score:** 0.635 (bullish)\n- **StockTwits Sentiment Score:** 1.0 (bullish)\n- **Reddit Sentiment Score:** 0.5 (neutral)\n\nGiven the weight of the inputs, the overall sentiment score can be approximated by averaging the scores weighted by the number of mentions/messages:\n\n(0.635 (Twitter) * 24 + 1.0 (StockTwits) * 30 + 0.5 (Reddit) * 0) / (24 + 30 + 0) = (15.24 + 30 + 0) / 54 = 0.840\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score:** **0.84**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\n- **Twitter Confidence:** Low\n- **StockTwits Confidence:** High\n- **Reddit Confidence:** Low\n\nGiven the high confidence from StockTwits in its strong bullish sentiment, and the low confidence from Twitter, the overall confidence level is primarily dictated by StockTwits.\n\n**Confidence Level:** **Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\n- Twitter is trending positively (bullish).\n- StockTwits sentiment is strongly bullish.\n- Reddit does not provide sufficient activity or sentiment influence due to lack of posts.\n\nSince the majority bullish sentiment from StockTwits and Twitter aligns positively, it indicates an upward trend.\n\n**Sentiment Trend:** **Rising**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Strong Bullish Sentiment on StockTwits:** With a sentiment score of 1.0 and 63.3% of the messages being bullish, StockTwits indicates a solid positive outlook for CAI.\n  \n2. **Low Engagement on Reddit:** There were no posts analyzed on Reddit, suggesting either a lack of discussion around CAI or potential underperformance in this community, which may limit sentiment analysis from that platform.\n\n3. **Positive Mentions on Twitter:** While the sentiment score on Twitter is lower at 0.635, the number of mentions (24) indicates active discussions, although with a lower confidence level.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nBased on the high overall sentiment score (0.84) and the bullish sentiment from both StockTwits and Twitter, combined with a rising trend, the recommendation would be to take a bullish position.\n\n**Trading Signal:** **BUY**\n\n**Rationale:** The decisive bullish sentiment from StockTwits (which has high confidence) and the active discussions on Twitter suggest that investors are optimistic about CAI's performance. The sentiment trend is rising, indicating potential for further positive movement in the stock price.",
