We have:\n\n   - **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.943 (High Confidence)\n   - **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.706 (Medium Confidence)\n   - **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.429 (High Confidence)\n\n   Using a simplified averaging method considering the confidence level, we can combine these to yield an overall sentiment score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.943 \\times 0.8) + (0.706 \\times 0.5) + (0.429 \\times 0.8)}{0.8 + 0.5 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.7544 + 0.353 + 0.3432}{2.1} \\approx 0.649\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the **Overall Sentiment Score** is approximately **0.649**.\n\n2. **Confidence Level**:  \n   Considering the available data:\n   - High confidence from Reddit and StockTwits, and medium from Twitter. \n   - Since we have only limited mentions from Twitter (2), this may lower the overall confidence.\n\n   Thus, the **Confidence Level** is adjusted to **Medium** due to the limited volume of data from Twitter.\n\n3. **Sentiment Trend**:  \n   Given that Reddit shows a high bullish sentiment score (0.943) and StockTwits shows a significant portion of bullish messages (33.3%) compared to bearish (13.3%), while Twitter is bullish too but with less volume, the sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. \n\n4. **Top 3 Key Insights**:\n   - **Insight 1**: Reddit shows a very high sentiment score (0.943) and a significant engagement level with an average of over 65 comments per post, indicating that discussions around META, especially in the r/stocks and r/StockMarket subreddits, are generally very positive.\n   - **Insight 2**: Twitter shows a bullish sentiment but with significantly lower mention volume (2 mentions), which limits the reliability of its sentiment.\n   - **Insight 3**: On StockTwits, while the sentiment score (0.429) is comparatively lower, the distinction between bullish (33.3%) and bearish (13.3%) messages emphasizes a split sentiment that still leans more bullish than bearish overall.\n\n   **Note**: The limited data from Twitter (only 2 mentions) means that insights derived from there should be taken with caution.\n\n5. **Trading Signal**:  \n   Given the overall sentiment score (0.649) is above neutral and is buoyed particularly by strong sentiment from Reddit, alongside a stable sentiment trend with more bullish than bearish messages on StockTwits, the recommended trading signal is a **BUY**. \n\n   **Rationale**: The strong sentiment from Reddit indicates investor confidence in META\u2019s prospects, suggesting potential upward price movement in the near term. While Twitter\u2019s data is limited, the collective sentiment from Reddit and StockTwits supports a positive outlook on META stock.",

We have:\n\n   - **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.943 (High Confidence)\n   - **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.706 (Medium Confidence)\n   - **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.429 (High Confidence)\n\n   Using a simplified averaging method considering the confidence level, we can combine these to yield an overall sentiment score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.943 \\times 0.8) + (0.706 \\times 0.5) + (0.429 \\times 0.8)}{0.8 + 0.5 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.7544 + 0.353 + 0.3432}{2.1} \\approx 0.649\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the **Overall Sentiment Score** is approximately **0.649**.\n\n2. **Confidence Level**:  \n   Considering the available data:\n   - High confidence from Reddit and StockTwits, and medium from Twitter. \n   - Since we have only limited mentions from Twitter (2), this may lower the overall confidence.\n\n   Thus, the **Confidence Level** is adjusted to **Medium** due to the limited volume of data from Twitter.\n\n3. **Sentiment Trend**:  \n   Given that Reddit shows a high bullish sentiment score (0.943) and StockTwits shows a significant portion of bullish messages (33.3%) compared to bearish (13.3%), while Twitter is bullish too but with less volume, the sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. \n\n4. **Top 3 Key Insights**:\n   - **Insight 1**: Reddit shows a very high sentiment score (0.943) and a significant engagement level with an average of over 65 comments per post, indicating that discussions around META, especially in the r/stocks and r/StockMarket subreddits, are generally very positive.\n   - **Insight 2**: Twitter shows a bullish sentiment but with significantly lower mention volume (2 mentions), which limits the reliability of its sentiment.\n   - **Insight 3**: On StockTwits, while the sentiment score (0.429) is comparatively lower, the distinction between bullish (33.3%) and bearish (13.3%) messages emphasizes a split sentiment that still leans more bullish than bearish overall.\n\n   **Note**: The limited data from Twitter (only 2 mentions) means that insights derived from there should be taken with caution.\n\n5. **Trading Signal**:  \n   Given the overall sentiment score (0.649) is above neutral and is buoyed particularly by strong sentiment from Reddit, alongside a stable sentiment trend with more bullish than bearish messages on StockTwits, the recommended trading signal is a **BUY**. \n\n   **Rationale**: The strong sentiment from Reddit indicates investor confidence in META\u2019s prospects, suggesting potential upward price movement in the near term. While Twitter\u2019s data is limited, the collective sentiment from Reddit and StockTwits supports a positive outlook on META stock.",

We have:\n\n   - **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.943 (High Confidence)\n   - **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.706 (Medium Confidence)\n   - **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.429 (High Confidence)\n\n   Using a simplified averaging method considering the confidence level, we can combine these to yield an overall sentiment score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.943 \\times 0.8) + (0.706 \\times 0.5) + (0.429 \\times 0.8)}{0.8 + 0.5 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.7544 + 0.353 + 0.3432}{2.1} \\approx 0.649\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the **Overall Sentiment Score** is approximately **0.649**.\n\n2. **Confidence Level**:  \n   Considering the available data:\n   - High confidence from Reddit and StockTwits, and medium from Twitter. \n   - Since we have only limited mentions from Twitter (2), this may lower the overall confidence.\n\n   Thus, the **Confidence Level** is adjusted to **Medium** due to the limited volume of data from Twitter.\n\n3. **Sentiment Trend**:  \n   Given that Reddit shows a high bullish sentiment score (0.943) and StockTwits shows a significant portion of bullish messages (33.3%) compared to bearish (13.3%), while Twitter is bullish too but with less volume, the sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. \n\n4. **Top 3 Key Insights**:\n   - **Insight 1**: Reddit shows a very high sentiment score (0.943) and a significant engagement level with an average of over 65 comments per post, indicating that discussions around META, especially in the r/stocks and r/StockMarket subreddits, are generally very positive.\n   - **Insight 2**: Twitter shows a bullish sentiment but with significantly lower mention volume (2 mentions), which limits the reliability of its sentiment.\n   - **Insight 3**: On StockTwits, while the sentiment score (0.429) is comparatively lower, the distinction between bullish (33.3%) and bearish (13.3%) messages emphasizes a split sentiment that still leans more bullish than bearish overall.\n\n   **Note**: The limited data from Twitter (only 2 mentions) means that insights derived from there should be taken with caution.\n\n5. **Trading Signal**:  \n   Given the overall sentiment score (0.649) is above neutral and is buoyed particularly by strong sentiment from Reddit, alongside a stable sentiment trend with more bullish than bearish messages on StockTwits, the recommended trading signal is a **BUY**. \n\n   **Rationale**: The strong sentiment from Reddit indicates investor confidence in META\u2019s prospects, suggesting potential upward price movement in the near term. While Twitter\u2019s data is limited, the collective sentiment from Reddit and StockTwits supports a positive outlook on META stock.",

We have:\n\n   - **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.943 (High Confidence)\n   - **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.706 (Medium Confidence)\n   - **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.429 (High Confidence)\n\n   Using a simplified averaging method considering the confidence level, we can combine these to yield an overall sentiment score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.943 \\times 0.8) + (0.706 \\times 0.5) + (0.429 \\times 0.8)}{0.8 + 0.5 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.7544 + 0.353 + 0.3432}{2.1} \\approx 0.649\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the **Overall Sentiment Score** is approximately **0.649**.\n\n2. **Confidence Level**:  \n   Considering the available data:\n   - High confidence from Reddit and StockTwits, and medium from Twitter. \n   - Since we have only limited mentions from Twitter (2), this may lower the overall confidence.\n\n   Thus, the **Confidence Level** is adjusted to **Medium** due to the limited volume of data from Twitter.\n\n3. **Sentiment Trend**:  \n   Given that Reddit shows a high bullish sentiment score (0.943) and StockTwits shows a significant portion of bullish messages (33.3%) compared to bearish (13.3%), while Twitter is bullish too but with less volume, the sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. \n\n4. **Top 3 Key Insights**:\n   - **Insight 1**: Reddit shows a very high sentiment score (0.943) and a significant engagement level with an average of over 65 comments per post, indicating that discussions around META, especially in the r/stocks and r/StockMarket subreddits, are generally very positive.\n   - **Insight 2**: Twitter shows a bullish sentiment but with significantly lower mention volume (2 mentions), which limits the reliability of its sentiment.\n   - **Insight 3**: On StockTwits, while the sentiment score (0.429) is comparatively lower, the distinction between bullish (33.3%) and bearish (13.3%) messages emphasizes a split sentiment that still leans more bullish than bearish overall.\n\n   **Note**: The limited data from Twitter (only 2 mentions) means that insights derived from there should be taken with caution.\n\n5. **Trading Signal**:  \n   Given the overall sentiment score (0.649) is above neutral and is buoyed particularly by strong sentiment from Reddit, alongside a stable sentiment trend with more bullish than bearish messages on StockTwits, the recommended trading signal is a **BUY**. \n\n   **Rationale**: The strong sentiment from Reddit indicates investor confidence in META\u2019s prospects, suggesting potential upward price movement in the near term. While Twitter\u2019s data is limited, the collective sentiment from Reddit and StockTwits supports a positive outlook on META stock.",

We have:\n\n   - **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.943 (High Confidence)\n   - **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.706 (Medium Confidence)\n   - **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.429 (High Confidence)\n\n   Using a simplified averaging method considering the confidence level, we can combine these to yield an overall sentiment score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.943 \\times 0.8) + (0.706 \\times 0.5) + (0.429 \\times 0.8)}{0.8 + 0.5 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.7544 + 0.353 + 0.3432}{2.1} \\approx 0.649\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the **Overall Sentiment Score** is approximately **0.649**.\n\n2. **Confidence Level**:  \n   Considering the available data:\n   - High confidence from Reddit and StockTwits, and medium from Twitter. \n   - Since we have only limited mentions from Twitter (2), this may lower the overall confidence.\n\n   Thus, the **Confidence Level** is adjusted to **Medium** due to the limited volume of data from Twitter.\n\n3. **Sentiment Trend**:  \n   Given that Reddit shows a high bullish sentiment score (0.943) and StockTwits shows a significant portion of bullish messages (33.3%) compared to bearish (13.3%), while Twitter is bullish too but with less volume, the sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. \n\n4. **Top 3 Key Insights**:\n   - **Insight 1**: Reddit shows a very high sentiment score (0.943) and a significant engagement level with an average of over 65 comments per post, indicating that discussions around META, especially in the r/stocks and r/StockMarket subreddits, are generally very positive.\n   - **Insight 2**: Twitter shows a bullish sentiment but with significantly lower mention volume (2 mentions), which limits the reliability of its sentiment.\n   - **Insight 3**: On StockTwits, while the sentiment score (0.429) is comparatively lower, the distinction between bullish (33.3%) and bearish (13.3%) messages emphasizes a split sentiment that still leans more bullish than bearish overall.\n\n   **Note**: The limited data from Twitter (only 2 mentions) means that insights derived from there should be taken with caution.\n\n5. **Trading Signal**:  \n   Given the overall sentiment score (0.649) is above neutral and is buoyed particularly by strong sentiment from Reddit, alongside a stable sentiment trend with more bullish than bearish messages on StockTwits, the recommended trading signal is a **BUY**. \n\n   **Rationale**: The strong sentiment from Reddit indicates investor confidence in META\u2019s prospects, suggesting potential upward price movement in the near term. While Twitter\u2019s data is limited, the collective sentiment from Reddit and StockTwits supports a positive outlook on META stock.",

We have:\n\n   - **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.943 (High Confidence)\n   - **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.706 (Medium Confidence)\n   - **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.429 (High Confidence)\n\n   Using a simplified averaging method considering the confidence level, we can combine these to yield an overall sentiment score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.943 \\times 0.8) + (0.706 \\times 0.5) + (0.429 \\times 0.8)}{0.8 + 0.5 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.7544 + 0.353 + 0.3432}{2.1} \\approx 0.649\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the **Overall Sentiment Score** is approximately **0.649**.\n\n2. **Confidence Level**:  \n   Considering the available data:\n   - High confidence from Reddit and StockTwits, and medium from Twitter. \n   - Since we have only limited mentions from Twitter (2), this may lower the overall confidence.\n\n   Thus, the **Confidence Level** is adjusted to **Medium** due to the limited volume of data from Twitter.\n\n3. **Sentiment Trend**:  \n   Given that Reddit shows a high bullish sentiment score (0.943) and StockTwits shows a significant portion of bullish messages (33.3%) compared to bearish (13.3%), while Twitter is bullish too but with less volume, the sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. \n\n4. **Top 3 Key Insights**:\n   - **Insight 1**: Reddit shows a very high sentiment score (0.943) and a significant engagement level with an average of over 65 comments per post, indicating that discussions around META, especially in the r/stocks and r/StockMarket subreddits, are generally very positive.\n   - **Insight 2**: Twitter shows a bullish sentiment but with significantly lower mention volume (2 mentions), which limits the reliability of its sentiment.\n   - **Insight 3**: On StockTwits, while the sentiment score (0.429) is comparatively lower, the distinction between bullish (33.3%) and bearish (13.3%) messages emphasizes a split sentiment that still leans more bullish than bearish overall.\n\n   **Note**: The limited data from Twitter (only 2 mentions) means that insights derived from there should be taken with caution.\n\n5. **Trading Signal**:  \n   Given the overall sentiment score (0.649) is above neutral and is buoyed particularly by strong sentiment from Reddit, alongside a stable sentiment trend with more bullish than bearish messages on StockTwits, the recommended trading signal is a **BUY**. \n\n   **Rationale**: The strong sentiment from Reddit indicates investor confidence in META\u2019s prospects, suggesting potential upward price movement in the near term. While Twitter\u2019s data is limited, the collective sentiment from Reddit and StockTwits supports a positive outlook on META stock.",

We have:\n\n   - **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.943 (High Confidence)\n   - **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.706 (Medium Confidence)\n   - **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.429 (High Confidence)\n\n   Using a simplified averaging method considering the confidence level, we can combine these to yield an overall sentiment score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.943 \\times 0.8) + (0.706 \\times 0.5) + (0.429 \\times 0.8)}{0.8 + 0.5 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.7544 + 0.353 + 0.3432}{2.1} \\approx 0.649\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the **Overall Sentiment Score** is approximately **0.649**.\n\n2. **Confidence Level**:  \n   Considering the available data:\n   - High confidence from Reddit and StockTwits, and medium from Twitter. \n   - Since we have only limited mentions from Twitter (2), this may lower the overall confidence.\n\n   Thus, the **Confidence Level** is adjusted to **Medium** due to the limited volume of data from Twitter.\n\n3. **Sentiment Trend**:  \n   Given that Reddit shows a high bullish sentiment score (0.943) and StockTwits shows a significant portion of bullish messages (33.3%) compared to bearish (13.3%), while Twitter is bullish too but with less volume, the sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. \n\n4. **Top 3 Key Insights**:\n   - **Insight 1**: Reddit shows a very high sentiment score (0.943) and a significant engagement level with an average of over 65 comments per post, indicating that discussions around META, especially in the r/stocks and r/StockMarket subreddits, are generally very positive.\n   - **Insight 2**: Twitter shows a bullish sentiment but with significantly lower mention volume (2 mentions), which limits the reliability of its sentiment.\n   - **Insight 3**: On StockTwits, while the sentiment score (0.429) is comparatively lower, the distinction between bullish (33.3%) and bearish (13.3%) messages emphasizes a split sentiment that still leans more bullish than bearish overall.\n\n   **Note**: The limited data from Twitter (only 2 mentions) means that insights derived from there should be taken with caution.\n\n5. **Trading Signal**:  \n   Given the overall sentiment score (0.649) is above neutral and is buoyed particularly by strong sentiment from Reddit, alongside a stable sentiment trend with more bullish than bearish messages on StockTwits, the recommended trading signal is a **BUY**. \n\n   **Rationale**: The strong sentiment from Reddit indicates investor confidence in META\u2019s prospects, suggesting potential upward price movement in the near term. While Twitter\u2019s data is limited, the collective sentiment from Reddit and StockTwits supports a positive outlook on META stock.",

We have:\n\n   - **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.943 (High Confidence)\n   - **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.706 (Medium Confidence)\n   - **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.429 (High Confidence)\n\n   Using a simplified averaging method considering the confidence level, we can combine these to yield an overall sentiment score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.943 \\times 0.8) + (0.706 \\times 0.5) + (0.429 \\times 0.8)}{0.8 + 0.5 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.7544 + 0.353 + 0.3432}{2.1} \\approx 0.649\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the **Overall Sentiment Score** is approximately **0.649**.\n\n2. **Confidence Level**:  \n   Considering the available data:\n   - High confidence from Reddit and StockTwits, and medium from Twitter. \n   - Since we have only limited mentions from Twitter (2), this may lower the overall confidence.\n\n   Thus, the **Confidence Level** is adjusted to **Medium** due to the limited volume of data from Twitter.\n\n3. **Sentiment Trend**:  \n   Given that Reddit shows a high bullish sentiment score (0.943) and StockTwits shows a significant portion of bullish messages (33.3%) compared to bearish (13.3%), while Twitter is bullish too but with less volume, the sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. \n\n4. **Top 3 Key Insights**:\n   - **Insight 1**: Reddit shows a very high sentiment score (0.943) and a significant engagement level with an average of over 65 comments per post, indicating that discussions around META, especially in the r/stocks and r/StockMarket subreddits, are generally very positive.\n   - **Insight 2**: Twitter shows a bullish sentiment but with significantly lower mention volume (2 mentions), which limits the reliability of its sentiment.\n   - **Insight 3**: On StockTwits, while the sentiment score (0.429) is comparatively lower, the distinction between bullish (33.3%) and bearish (13.3%) messages emphasizes a split sentiment that still leans more bullish than bearish overall.\n\n   **Note**: The limited data from Twitter (only 2 mentions) means that insights derived from there should be taken with caution.\n\n5. **Trading Signal**:  \n   Given the overall sentiment score (0.649) is above neutral and is buoyed particularly by strong sentiment from Reddit, alongside a stable sentiment trend with more bullish than bearish messages on StockTwits, the recommended trading signal is a **BUY**. \n\n   **Rationale**: The strong sentiment from Reddit indicates investor confidence in META\u2019s prospects, suggesting potential upward price movement in the near term. While Twitter\u2019s data is limited, the collective sentiment from Reddit and StockTwits supports a positive outlook on META stock.",

We have:\n\n   - **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.943 (High Confidence)\n   - **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.706 (Medium Confidence)\n   - **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.429 (High Confidence)\n\n   Using a simplified averaging method considering the confidence level, we can combine these to yield an overall sentiment score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Overall Sentiment Score} = \\frac{(0.943 \\times 0.8) + (0.706 \\times 0.5) + (0.429 \\times 0.8)}{0.8 + 0.5 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.7544 + 0.353 + 0.3432}{2.1} \\approx 0.649\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the **Overall Sentiment Score** is approximately **0.649**.\n\n2. **Confidence Level**:  \n   Considering the available data:\n   - High confidence from Reddit and StockTwits, and medium from Twitter. \n   - Since we have only limited mentions from Twitter (2), this may lower the overall confidence.\n\n   Thus, the **Confidence Level** is adjusted to **Medium** due to the limited volume of data from Twitter.\n\n3. **Sentiment Trend**:  \n   Given that Reddit shows a high bullish sentiment score (0.943) and StockTwits shows a significant portion of bullish messages (33.3%) compared to bearish (13.3%), while Twitter is bullish too but with less volume, the sentiment trend appears to be **Stable**. \n\n4. **Top 3 Key Insights**:\n   - **Insight 1**: Reddit shows a very high sentiment score (0.943) and a significant engagement level with an average of over 65 comments per post, indicating that discussions around META, especially in the r/stocks and r/StockMarket subreddits, are generally very positive.\n   - **Insight 2**: Twitter shows a bullish sentiment but with significantly lower mention volume (2 mentions), which limits the reliability of its sentiment.\n   - **Insight 3**: On StockTwits, while the sentiment score (0.429) is comparatively lower, the distinction between bullish (33.3%) and bearish (13.3%) messages emphasizes a split sentiment that still leans more bullish than bearish overall.\n\n   **Note**: The limited data from Twitter (only 2 mentions) means that insights derived from there should be taken with caution.\n\n5. **Trading Signal**:  \n   Given the overall sentiment score (0.649) is above neutral and is buoyed particularly by strong sentiment from Reddit, alongside a stable sentiment trend with more bullish than bearish messages on StockTwits, the recommended trading signal is a **BUY**. \n\n   **Rationale**: The strong sentiment from Reddit indicates investor confidence in META\u2019s prospects, suggesting potential upward price movement in the near term. While Twitter\u2019s data is limited, the collective sentiment from Reddit and StockTwits supports a positive outlook on META stock.",
