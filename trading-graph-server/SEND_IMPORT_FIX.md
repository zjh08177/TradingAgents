# Send Import Fix for LangGraph Parallel Execution

## Issue
The langgraph server was failing to start with the following error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Send' from 'langgraph.prebuilt'
```

## Root Cause
The `Send` class was being imported from the wrong module. The implementation in `dispatcher.py` was trying to import from `langgraph.prebuilt`, but the correct import path is `langgraph.types`.

## Solution
Changed the import statement in two files:

### 1. `/src/agent/graph/nodes/dispatcher.py` (line 14)
```python
# Before:
from langgraph.prebuilt import Send

# After:
from langgraph.types import Send
```

### 2. `/validate_optimizations.py` (line 21)
```python
# Before:
from langgraph.prebuilt import Send

# After:
from langgraph.types import Send
```

## Verification
The fix has been verified by:
1. Successfully importing the Send class with the corrected path
2. Running the validation script which now passes 4/7 tests (the failures are due to missing dependencies like aiohttp, not the Send import)

## Impact
This fix restores the ability to use Send-based parallel execution in the trading graph server, which is critical for achieving the performance optimization goals of reducing execution time from 248-590s to under 120s.

## Next Steps
1. Run `langgraph dev` to verify the server starts correctly
2. Execute `debug_local.sh` for full integration testing
3. Monitor parallel execution performance metrics to ensure the optimizations are working as expected
