# Debug Local Script Without Virtual Environment - Changes Summary

## Overview
Created a modified version of `debug_local.sh` that runs without using a virtual environment, instead using the local/system Python installation.

## Files Created
- `debug_local_novenv.sh` - Modified debug script that uses local Python environment

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Virtual Environment Setup
- **Original**: Lines 376-394 checked for and activated virtual environment
- **Modified**: Removed all venv-related code

### 2. Python Detection
- **Original**: Used `python3.11` specifically from venv
- **Modified**: Uses system `python3` or `python` command, whichever is available

### 3. Package Installation
- **Original**: Installed packages in virtual environment using `pip install`
- **Modified**: Installs packages with `--user` flag for local user installation

### 4. Import Path Adjustments
- **Original**: Relied on venv's site-packages
- **Modified**: Uses `PYTHONPATH` to include `src` directory and user-installed packages

### 5. Environment Variables
- **Original**: Sourced `.env` after venv activation
- **Modified**: Sources `.env` using `set -a` and `set +a` for proper variable export

## Usage

### Running the Script
```bash
# Basic mode (faster, less validation)
./debug_local_novenv.sh --basic-mode

# Studio mirror mode (comprehensive validation)
./debug_local_novenv.sh --studio-mirror

# Show help
./debug_local_novenv.sh --help
```

### Requirements
- System Python 3.x installation
- pip available for package management
- User permissions to install packages with `pip install --user`

## Benefits
1. **No Virtual Environment Overhead**: Faster startup and no venv management
2. **System-Wide Packages**: Uses packages already installed on the system
3. **Simpler Setup**: No need to create or maintain virtual environments
4. **Direct Execution**: Can run directly without activation steps

## Potential Issues
1. **Package Conflicts**: May conflict with system-installed packages
2. **Version Mismatches**: System Python version may differ from project requirements
3. **Permission Issues**: May need sudo for some package installations (not recommended)
4. **PATH Issues**: User-installed packages must be in PATH

## Recommendations
- Ensure your system Python version is compatible (Python 3.8+)
- Check that required packages don't conflict with system packages
- Consider using this script for quick debugging only
- For production or consistent development, virtual environments are still recommended
