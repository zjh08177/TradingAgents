# Performance Regression Analysis

## Overview
A performance regression of 37.1% was observed between consecutive runs with the same implementation.

## Trace Comparison

### Trace 2 (Best Performance)
- **ID**: 1f06ef80-68fb-6eb6-8ebc-025ebe8aa5ed
- **Duration**: 157.86s
- **Tokens**: 48,353
- **Token Throughput**: 306.3 tokens/second
- **Avg Chain Time**: 11.42s

### Trace 3 (Regression)
- **ID**: 1f06ef93-2dc3-6354-9b23-cb0e5655d1ab
- **Duration**: 216.37s (+37.1%)
- **Tokens**: 42,644 (-11.8%)
- **Token Throughput**: 197.1 tokens/second (-35.7%)
- **Avg Chain Time**: 13.43s (+17.5%)

## Key Observations

1. **Token Count Decreased**: Despite taking longer, Trace 3 used fewer tokens (42,644 vs 48,353)
2. **Token Throughput Dropped**: From 306.3 to 197.1 tokens/second
3. **Chain Time Increased**: Average chain execution time increased by 2 seconds

## Possible Causes

### 1. API Response Time Variability
- OpenAI API latency can vary significantly
- Network conditions may have changed
- API server load could be higher

### 2. Cache State
- First run (Trace 2) may have had cold caches
- Second run (Trace 3) might have cache misses if TTL expired
- Tool result caching effectiveness varies with data freshness

### 3. System Load
- Local system resources (CPU, memory) affect performance
- Background processes could impact execution
- Python GC (garbage collection) cycles

### 4. Data Complexity
- Different stock data or date ranges
- Market conditions affecting tool response times
- News/social media API response variability

### 5. Parallel Execution Variability
- Thread scheduling differences
- Resource contention in parallel operations
- Asyncio event loop performance variations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Run Multiple Traces**: Execute 3-5 more traces to establish a performance baseline
2. **Monitor System Resources**: Check CPU and memory usage during execution
3. **Check API Latencies**: Log individual API response times

### Performance Stabilization
1. **Implement Retry Logic**: Add exponential backoff for slow API calls
2. **Enhanced Caching**: Increase cache TTL for stable data
3. **Connection Pool Tuning**: Adjust pool size based on concurrent needs
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Add performance counters to identify bottlenecks

### Code Improvements
```python
# Add timing logs for each API call
start = time.time()
result = await api_call()
duration = time.time() - start
if duration > 5:  # Log slow calls
    logger.warning(f"Slow API call: {api_name} took {duration:.2f}s")
```

## Conclusion

The 37.1% performance regression appears to be due to external factors (API latency, system load) rather than code issues. The implementation remains sound, but performance variability is expected in distributed systems with external dependencies.

To achieve consistent sub-120s performance:
1. Implement aggressive caching
2. Add request retry/timeout logic
3. Monitor and optimize slow API calls
4. Consider running during off-peak hours
5. Use connection pooling (install aiohttp)
