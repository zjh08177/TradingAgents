# Social Media Analyst Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

**Current Grade: D (62/100)** → **Target Grade: A (90/100)**

The social media analyst requires comprehensive overhaul from broken tool ecosystem to institutional-grade social intelligence system. Critical issues include disabled Reddit tools, mock implementations, and inadequate data collection capabilities.

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Failures
- **Tool Crisis**: Reddit tool disabled due to division by zero error
- **Mock Data**: StockTwits/Twitter return placeholder data only
- **Zero Real Sources**: Effectively no social media data collection
- **Poor Prompt**: 46-word prompt with no structured reasoning

### Implementation Issues
```yaml
File Location: /src/agent/analysts/social_media_analyst.py
Current Tools:
  - get_reddit_stock_info: DISABLED (division by zero)
  - get_stocktwits_sentiment: Mock implementation
  - get_twitter_mentions: Mock implementation
  - get_stock_news_openai: Not social media specific
```

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Reddit Tool Failure**: Division by zero at line 504 when posts array empty
2. **Inadequate Tool Ecosystem**: No real social media data sources
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Lacks two-phase architecture and reasoning framework
4. **No Fallback Systems**: Single point of failure with no recovery

## Comprehensive Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: Tool Ecosystem Overhaul (Week 1)

#### Ultrafast Tool Implementation
Based on research findings, implement production-grade social media tools:

##### Twitter Scraping Tool
- **Library**: `twscrape` with account rotation
- **Performance**: 1000+ tweets in <10 seconds
- **Capabilities**: Async architecture, rate limit evasion
- **Data Sources**: $TICKER searches, sentiment analysis, influencer tracking

##### Reddit Scraping Tool  
- **Approach**: Direct web scraping (no API limits)
- **Performance**: 500+ posts in <8 seconds
- **Coverage**: Multiple financial subreddits simultaneously
- **Features**: Engagement metrics, temporal analysis

#### Tool Integration Architecture
```yaml
Social Tools Strategy:
  primary_tools:
    - TwitterScrapingTool: Real-time tweet collection
    - RedditScrapingTool: Discussion thread analysis
    
  supplementary_tools:
    - StockTwits API: Official sentiment data
    - Discord Monitoring: Community discussions
    - YouTube Comments: Video sentiment analysis
    
  fallback_systems:
    - Cross-platform validation
    - Data quality scoring
    - Graceful degradation protocols
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Prompt Engineering (Week 2)

#### Two-Phase Architecture Implementation
Replace current 46-word prompt with comprehensive V5 natural language system:

You are an Elite Social Sentiment Analyst for {ticker}. Your role combines exhaustive data gathering with intelligent synthesis.

DATA GATHERING PHASE
Systematically call every available social tool to collect maximum data about {ticker}. Gather all posts, comments, likes, shares, and metadata from Reddit, Twitter, StockTwits, and other platforms. Don't pre-filter - capture everything including high-quality analysis, casual comments, bull and bear views, influencer posts, and even spam. If initial queries return limited data, try variations. Absence of discussion is also valuable data to note.

INTELLIGENT SYNTHESIS PHASE
Transform raw data into actionable intelligence:

First, eliminate redundancy while preserving unique value. Keep original sources and viral versions of similar content.

Next, evaluate signal quality by considering author credibility (followers, history), content substance (specific vs vague), engagement authenticity (real vs bots), and temporal relevance (recent but noting patterns).

Then extract critical insights: identify dominant and emerging narratives, detect sentiment momentum and shifts, spot unusual patterns or anomalies, recognize coordination or manipulation, and understand influencer versus retail positioning.

Finally, produce clear intelligence output:

HEADLINE INTELLIGENCE
- Sentiment Score: [X/100] with [high/medium/low] confidence
- Market Signal: [BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL/MIXED]
- Urgency Level: [immediate action/developing/stable]

KEY DISCOVERIES [Top 5]
1. [Finding]: [Supporting evidence] → [Implication]
2. [Finding]: [Supporting evidence] → [Implication]
[Continue pattern]

NARRATIVE LANDSCAPE
- Bull Story: [Core thesis and who's pushing it]
- Bear Story: [Main concerns and who's worried]  
- New Development: [Emerging narrative to watch]
