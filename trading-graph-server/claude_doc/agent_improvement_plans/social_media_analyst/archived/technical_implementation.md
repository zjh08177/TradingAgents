# Social Media Analyst Technical Implementation

## Ultrafast Tool Implementation Details

### Research-Based Tool Selection

**Twitter Scraping**: `twscrape` library
- **Performance**: Can scrape millions of tweets with async architecture
- **Rate Limits**: Bypasses API limits through account rotation  
- **Architecture**: Built on httpx/asyncio for maximum speed
- **Reliability**: Handles Twitter's anti-bot measures effectively

**Reddit Scraping**: Direct web scraping approach
- **Performance**: No API rate limits with direct HTML parsing
- **Target**: old.reddit.com for simplified parsing
- **Architecture**: AsyncIO + httpx for concurrent requests  
- **Reliability**: Bypasses Reddit API quotas entirely

### Tool Architecture Design

#### 1. Twitter Tool Implementation (`TwitterScrapingTool`)

**Core Dependencies**:
- `twscrape`: Primary scraping engine with account rotation
- `httpx`: High-performance async HTTP client  
- `asyncio`: Concurrent execution management

**Natural Language Algorithm**:
1. Generate search queries: $TICKER, company name, stock mentions
2. Execute concurrent searches across account pool
3. Collect tweets from last N days with engagement metrics
4. Extract sentiment indicators: emojis, keywords, engagement ratios
5. Aggregate results with deduplication and noise filtering
6. Return structured sentiment data with confidence scores

**Expected Output Structure**:
```json
{
    "platform": "twitter",
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "timeframe_days": 7,
    "total_tweets": 1247,
    "sentiment_score": 72,
    "trend_direction": "rising",
    "confidence_level": 85,
    "key_themes": ["earnings", "iPhone", "AI"],
    "influencer_sentiment": "bullish",
    "volume_trend": "increasing",
    "raw_data_count": 1247
}
```

#### 2. Reddit Tool Implementation (`RedditScrapingTool`)

**Natural Language Algorithm**:
1. Generate search URLs for target subreddits and timeframes
2. Scrape post titles, content, scores, and comment counts concurrently
3. Filter for ticker mentions and relevant stock discussions
4. Extract sentiment from post titles, content, and engagement metrics
5. Analyze comment sentiment and discussion themes
6. Aggregate with confidence scoring and trend analysis
7. Return structured sentiment data with discussion insights

**Target Subreddits**:
- wallstreetbets (retail sentiment)
- stocks (general stock discussion)
- investing (investment analysis)
- SecurityAnalysis (fundamental analysis)
- ValueInvesting (value investing perspective)
- StockMarket (market discussion)
- financialindependence (long-term perspective)

**Expected Output Structure**:
```json
{
    "platform": "reddit",
    "ticker": "AAPL", 
    "timeframe_days": 7,
    "total_posts": 342,
    "sentiment_score": 68,
    "trend_direction": "stable",
    "confidence_level": 78,
    "discussion_themes": ["dividend", "buyback", "valuation"],
    "subreddit_breakdown": {"wallstreetbets": 145, "stocks": 89},
    "engagement_metrics": {"avg_upvotes": 23, "avg_comments": 12},
    "time_distribution": {"peak_hour": 14},
    "raw_data_count": 342
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### Async Architecture Benefits
- **Concurrent Requests**: 10-15 simultaneous connections per tool
- **Non-Blocking I/O**: httpx async client for maximum throughput
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming data processing, minimal memory footprint
- **Error Resilience**: Individual request failures don't block entire collection

#### Rate Limit Evasion Strategies
- **Twitter**: Account rotation pool prevents per-account limits
- **Reddit**: Direct scraping bypasses API quotas entirely
- **Request Spacing**: Intelligent delays between requests to avoid detection
- **User-Agent Rotation**: Randomized browser headers for stealth

#### Data Quality Enhancements
- **Deduplication**: Content hashing prevents duplicate data
- **Relevance Filtering**: Advanced keyword matching for ticker-specific content
- **Sentiment Calibration**: Multi-signal sentiment analysis (text + engagement)
- **Temporal Analysis**: Time-weighted sentiment for trend detection

## Integration with Enhanced Social Analyst

### Natural Language Coordination
The enhanced social analyst uses these tools with natural language coordination:

```yaml
Social Analyst Enhanced Prompt:
"You are analyzing social sentiment for [TICKER] using ultrafast Twitter and Reddit tools.

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:
1. Execute Twitter sentiment search for comprehensive coverage
2. Execute Reddit sentiment search across financial subreddits  
3. Cross-validate sentiment signals between platforms
4. Identify sentiment divergence and convergence patterns
5. Extract actionable trading insights from social data

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- Quantify overall sentiment score (-100 to +100) with confidence levels
- Identify trending themes and discussion topics driving sentiment
- Detect sentiment momentum (rising/falling/stable) with temporal analysis
- Assess retail investor positioning and institutional sentiment signals
- Flag viral content or unusual discussion volume spikes

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
- Executive Summary: BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendation with confidence
- Platform Analysis: Twitter vs Reddit sentiment comparison
- Trend Analysis: Momentum direction and strength indicators
- Risk Assessment: Reputation risks and viral content exposure
- Key Insights: Specific social signals affecting stock perception"
```

### Expected Performance Metrics

**Speed Targets**:
- Twitter: 1000+ tweets in <10 seconds
- Reddit: 500+ posts in <8 seconds
- Combined social analysis: <20 seconds total

**Quality Targets**:
- Sentiment accuracy: >85% correlation with market movements
- Data freshness: <5 minutes from social platform posting
- Coverage completeness: >95% of relevant social mentions

**Reliability Targets**:
- Uptime: >99.5% tool availability
- Error recovery: <2 second failover to backup methods
- Rate limit evasion: >99% success rate
