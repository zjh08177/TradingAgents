  analyst_nodes = ["market_analyst", "news_analyst", "social_analyst", "fundamentals_analyst"]
  graph.add_edge(START, analyst_nodes)
  graph.add_edge(analyst_nodes, "bull_researcher")
  ```
- [ ] **Remove Send API dispatcher files**
  ```bash
  rm src/agent/graph/send_api_dispatcher.py
  git rm src/agent/graph/send_api_dispatcher.py

## Rollout Strategy

### Gradual Deployment
1. **Development Environment**: Implement and test all phases
2. **Staging Environment**: Run parallel with current system
3. **Production Pilot**: 10% of analyses use simplified system
4. **Full Rollout**: 100% traffic after validation period

### Monitoring and Validation
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Track performance, quality, and error metrics
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare simplified vs complex system decisions
- **Automated Alerts**: Immediate notification of quality degradation
- **Quick Rollback**: One-click revert to complex system if needed
