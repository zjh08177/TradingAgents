## Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Competitive Analysis Integration (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Add comprehensive peer comparison capabilities

#### Auto-Peer Identification System
```yaml
Peer Analysis Framework:
  direct_competitors:
    description: Primary business competitors
    use_case: Head-to-head performance comparison
    
  industry_peers:
    description: Same industry segment companies
    use_case: Industry-relative valuation metrics
    
  size_peers:
    description: Similar market cap companies
    use_case: Size-adjusted performance benchmarks
```

#### Competitive Metrics Implementation
- **Relative Valuation**: P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA vs peers
- **Performance Comparison**: Revenue growth, margin analysis
- **Market Position**: Market share and competitive advantages
- **Efficiency Metrics**: ROE, ROIC, asset turnover vs industry

### Phase 2: Forward-Looking Analysis (Week 3)
**Goal**: Integrate predictive financial data

#### Forward Data Integration
```yaml
Predictive Analytics:
  consensus_estimates:
    description: Wall Street analyst forecasts
    metrics: EPS, Revenue, Growth rates
    
  company_guidance:
    description: Management forward guidance
    use_case: Compare guidance vs estimates
    
  revision_trends:
    description: Estimate revision patterns
    use_case: Momentum and confidence indicators
```

#### Implementation Features
- **Consensus Analysis**: Aggregate analyst estimates and confidence levels
- **Guidance Tracking**: Management forecast accuracy and reliability
- **Revision Momentum**: Positive/negative estimate revision trends
- **Surprise History**: Beat/miss patterns and market reactions

### Phase 3: Advanced Fundamental Analysis (Week 4-5)
**Goal**: Enhanced analytical depth and quality

#### Quality Score Framework
- **Financial Health**: Debt levels, cash flow quality, working capital
- **Growth Quality**: Organic vs inorganic, sustainability metrics
- **Management Quality**: Capital allocation, strategic execution
- **Competitive Moats**: Sustainable competitive advantages

#### Risk Assessment Enhancement
- **Balance Sheet Risk**: Debt maturity, covenant compliance
- **Operational Risk**: Customer concentration, regulatory exposure  
- **Market Risk**: Cyclicality, sensitivity analysis
- **Execution Risk**: Management track record, strategic challenges

## Technical Implementation

### Data Source Integration
```yaml
Primary Sources:
  - SimFin: Financial statements and ratios
  - Finnhub: Market data and estimates
  - SEC EDGAR: Regulatory filings
  
Enhanced Sources:
  - FactSet: Peer analysis data
  - Thomson Reuters: Consensus estimates
  - S&P Capital IQ: Industry comparisons
  
Alternative Data:
  - Satellite data for retail/industrial activity
  - Patent filings for innovation tracking
  - Management sentiment analysis
```

### Analysis Architecture
1. **Data Collection**: Multi-source financial data aggregation
2. **Peer Identification**: Automatic competitor and industry peer mapping
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Relative valuation and performance metrics
