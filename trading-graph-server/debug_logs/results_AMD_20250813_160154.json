These factors suggest a re-pricing opportunity that has not been fully captured by the current fundamentals.  \n\u2022 Bear Perspective: Cautions center on high valuation metrics and bearish technical signals (e.g., MACD) that raise the possibility of further declines or a short squeeze scenario.  \n\u2022 Final Decision: Balancing these views leads to a conviction for a LONG position\u2014but with a protective overlay. By entering cautiously and hedging risk exposure, you benefit from the growth catalysts while limiting the impact of potential negative technical or fundamental shifts.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nConclusion  \n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nProceed with initiating a moderately sized long position in AMD using a staggered entry at supportive technical levels (~$169\u2013$170). Simultaneously, manage downside risk via stop loss orders and consider using OTM put options for additional protection. With a medium-term horizon of weeks to months, monitor key earnings, market catalysts, and technical break points to adapt your strategy as the market evolves. This balanced approach integrates the bullish view of mispriced growth potential with the bear warnings of elevated risk, offering a prudent path forward.",

      "bull_history": "Building on the bear\u2019s point about AMD\u2019s stretched valuation metrics (notably a P/E over 105 and an EV/FCF of 73), we\u2019ve deep\u2010dived into the catalysts that justify a premium multiple. While the fundamental numbers appear \u201cexpensive\u201d by traditional metrics, AMD\u2019s real strength lies in its transformational product pipeline in high\u2010growth areas (including AI accelerators, next\u2010gen GPU architectures, and data center semi-custom solutions) which we believe will fuel TAM expansion and unlock significant margin expansion over the next 18\u201324 months.

      "current_safe_response": "Below is a conservative risk perspective on the proposed AMD investment, with a strong focus on capital preservation and strategies to mitigate potential losses:\n\n1. Capital Preservation Strategies  \n\u2003\u2022 Limit initial exposure: Only allocate a small, manageable portion (5%\u20137% of your total portfolio) to AMD, ensuring that a downturn in this position won\u2019t significantly impact overall capital.  \n\u2003\u2022 Gradual, staged entry: Use a staggered entry approach (e.g., limit orders near technical support levels of around $169\u2013$170) instead of a lump-sum buy. This can help avoid entering at an overheated price and reduce exposure if the stock reverses rapidly.  \n\u2003\u2022 Use predefined exit points: Set clear stop loss levels (7%\u201310% below your average entry price) to automatically exit if the stock deteriorates, preserving your capital.\n\n2. Potential Downside Risks and Worst-Case Scenarios  \n\u2003\u2022 Technical breakdown: A sustained move below the SMA 20 or other key support levels could indicate a fundamental shift in sentiment. In a worst-case scenario, if a major technical breakdown occurs, the stock could experience a sharp decline, triggering stop losses and accelerating losses.  \n\u2003\u2022 Overvaluation concerns: AMD\u2019s high P/E and EV/FCF multiples suggest the stock is priced with strong growth expectations. Any disappointment in earnings or future growth may result in a sudden re-rating, causing significant drawdowns.  \n\u2003\u2022 Market volatility and sentiment shifts: Rapid changes in social sentiment or unexpected market-wide corrections could lead to sharp short-term volatility, which might exacerbate losses before technical recovery is observed.  \n\u2003\u2022 Macro factors or negative news: Unforeseen shifts in industry trends, supply chain issues, or regulatory changes affecting semiconductors can lead to broader market sentiment turning bearish.\n\n3. Risk Mitigation and Hedging Strategies  \n\u2003\u2022 Stop loss orders: Enforce strict stop loss levels (7%\u201310% below your average entry price) to automatically cap losses if the market moves against your position.  \n\u2003\u2022 Hedging with options: Consider purchasing out-of-the-money (OTM) put options or establishing a put spread. This \u201cbelt-and-suspenders\u201d approach can provide insurance against sharp downturns while allowing you to benefit from any upward movement.  \n\u2003\u2022 Active monitoring and readiness to adjust: Keep a close eye on technical indicators such as the MACD, RSI, and moving averages. If these signals confirm growing bearishness, be prepared to reduce your position or exit to protect capital.  \n\u2003\u2022 Diversification: Maintain a diversified portfolio so that any negative performance in AMD will not overly impact your overall portfolio performance.\n\n4. Safe Position Sizing Recommendations  \n\u2003\u2022 Keep the allocation limited: Invest only 5%\u20137% of your portfolio in AMD to ensure that potential losses remain a small fraction of your total capital.  \n\u2003\u2022 Use proportional risk management: Align your stop loss size and hedging strategy so that the maximum expected loss remains within an acceptable threshold relative to your total portfolio. If the stop loss is triggered, the loss from AMD should not disrupt the broader portfolio\u2019s stability.  \n\u2003\u2022 Periodic rebalancing: Regularly review your allocation and adjust your position size in response to changes in market conditions, technical signals, or if the overall risk profile of AMD changes relative to your other investments.\n\nBy following these conservative strategies, you\u2019ll be positioned to capture potential upside\u2014if AMD continues its growth trajectory\u2014while effectively safeguarding against significant losses. This balanced, risk-aware approach is key to preserving capital in volatile market conditions while still participating in strategic growth opportunities.",
      "risky_history": "Risky Analyst: From an aggressive risk analyst perspective, here's why this AMD play is worth a go:\n\n1. High-Reward Opportunities & Growth Potential:\n\u2003\u2022 AMD is in the midst of a strategic growth narrative. The company\u2019s strong market presence, bolstered by robust social media sentiment (with stellar bullish signals on Reddit and StockTwits), suggests that there's a huge re-pricing opportunity waiting to be unlocked.\n\u2003\u2022 The potential for breakthrough earnings and favorable industry catalysts (like increased semiconductor demand and innovative tech developments) provide an enticing upside. A phased entry at technical support zones (around the SMA 20 at $169\u2013$170) sets the stage to capture significant upside if the momentum carries forward.\n\u2003\u2022 Technicals indicate a bullish trend overall, and if the stock successfully holds above key support levels, the reactivity among traders could lead to rapid, high-reward upward moves.\n\n2. Why the Risks Are Worth Taking:\n\u2003\u2022 While the valuation metrics (a high P/E and elevated EV/FCF) hint at lofty expectations, they also signal that there is room for a market \"reset\" if the growth catalysts materialize. The current environment is ripe for mispriced growth to be corrected, potentially driving dramatic gains.\n\u2003\u2022 Despite bearish indicators like the MACD, the aggressive sentiment on social platforms suggests that investor enthusiasm could overwhelm technical concerns, leading to an explosive upward move.\n\u2003\u2022 By deploying a controlled, aggressive trade (allocating 5%\u20137% of your portfolio), you can capitalize on the high growth potential without overexposing your portfolio to a single stock.\n\n3. Potential Upside Scenarios:\n\u2003\u2022 Earnings surprises: A better-than-expected earnings report or positive guidance can serve as a catalyst\u2014possibly triggering a rapid move as investors reprice the stock.\n\u2003\u2022 Technical reversal: If price action rebounds from the identified support levels (around $169\u2013$170), it could spark a strong bullish trend supported by renewed momentum and easing technical concerns such as the MACD divergence.\n\u2003\u2022 Catalyst events: Future semiconductor trends, breakthroughs, or favorable supply chain news can ignite fresh investor interest, further fueling the stock\u2019s run higher. This aligns with the strong social sentiment showing that the market is ready to reward AMD\u2019s growth story.\n\n4. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Aggressive Positions:\n\u2003\u2022 Staggered Entry: Instead of a lump-sum purchase, use a phased buying strategy to average your cost around key technical support zones. This approach optimizes entry points during pullbacks and minimizes exposure to short-term volatility.\n\u2003\u2022 Stop Loss Orders: To curb potential drawdowns, set a stop loss roughly 7%\u201310% below your average entry price. This will ensure that your downside risk remains capped if the trade doesn\u2019t move in your favor.\n\u2003\u2022 Hedging with Options: As an extra layer of protection, consider using out-of-the-money (OTM) put options or put spreads. This provides a safety net if the stock experiences a swift, turbulent drop, enabling you to limit losses while staying positioned for upside.\n\u2003\u2022 Continuous Monitoring: Regularly track key technical indicators (like SMA support and MACD trends) and fundamental catalysts (earnings releases, supply chain updates, etc.). This ensures that you can exit or adjust your position rapidly if market conditions shift.\n\u2003\nIn summary, while the aggressive nature of this trade inherently carries risks\u2014chiefly related to elevated valuations and short-term technical warnings\u2014the potential for high-growth, catalyst-driven upside makes it a compelling opportunity. By employing a staggered entry strategy, tight stop losses, and hedging with options, you can actively manage the risks while positioning yourself to capture substantial gains. This balanced yet aggressive approach is designed to exploit the high-reward potential while keeping downside exposure in check.",

Simultaneously, manage downside risk via stop loss orders and consider using OTM put options for additional protection. With a medium-term horizon of weeks to months, monitor key earnings, market catalysts, and technical break points to adapt your strategy as the market evolves. This balanced approach integrates the bullish view of mispriced growth potential with the bear warnings of elevated risk, offering a prudent path forward.",

      "safe_history": "Safe Analyst: Below is a conservative risk perspective on the proposed AMD investment, with a strong focus on capital preservation and strategies to mitigate potential losses:\n\n1. Capital Preservation Strategies  \n\u2003\u2022 Limit initial exposure: Only allocate a small, manageable portion (5%\u20137% of your total portfolio) to AMD, ensuring that a downturn in this position won\u2019t significantly impact overall capital.  \n\u2003\u2022 Gradual, staged entry: Use a staggered entry approach (e.g., limit orders near technical support levels of around $169\u2013$170) instead of a lump-sum buy. This can help avoid entering at an overheated price and reduce exposure if the stock reverses rapidly.  \n\u2003\u2022 Use predefined exit points: Set clear stop loss levels (7%\u201310% below your average entry price) to automatically exit if the stock deteriorates, preserving your capital.\n\n2. Potential Downside Risks and Worst-Case Scenarios  \n\u2003\u2022 Technical breakdown: A sustained move below the SMA 20 or other key support levels could indicate a fundamental shift in sentiment. In a worst-case scenario, if a major technical breakdown occurs, the stock could experience a sharp decline, triggering stop losses and accelerating losses.  \n\u2003\u2022 Overvaluation concerns: AMD\u2019s high P/E and EV/FCF multiples suggest the stock is priced with strong growth expectations. Any disappointment in earnings or future growth may result in a sudden re-rating, causing significant drawdowns.  \n\u2003\u2022 Market volatility and sentiment shifts: Rapid changes in social sentiment or unexpected market-wide corrections could lead to sharp short-term volatility, which might exacerbate losses before technical recovery is observed.  \n\u2003\u2022 Macro factors or negative news: Unforeseen shifts in industry trends, supply chain issues, or regulatory changes affecting semiconductors can lead to broader market sentiment turning bearish.\n\n3. Risk Mitigation and Hedging Strategies  \n\u2003\u2022 Stop loss orders: Enforce strict stop loss levels (7%\u201310% below your average entry price) to automatically cap losses if the market moves against your position.  \n\u2003\u2022 Hedging with options: Consider purchasing out-of-the-money (OTM) put options or establishing a put spread. This \u201cbelt-and-suspenders\u201d approach can provide insurance against sharp downturns while allowing you to benefit from any upward movement.  \n\u2003\u2022 Active monitoring and readiness to adjust: Keep a close eye on technical indicators such as the MACD, RSI, and moving averages. If these signals confirm growing bearishness, be prepared to reduce your position or exit to protect capital.  \n\u2003\u2022 Diversification: Maintain a diversified portfolio so that any negative performance in AMD will not overly impact your overall portfolio performance.\n\n4. Safe Position Sizing Recommendations  \n\u2003\u2022 Keep the allocation limited: Invest only 5%\u20137% of your portfolio in AMD to ensure that potential losses remain a small fraction of your total capital.  \n\u2003\u2022 Use proportional risk management: Align your stop loss size and hedging strategy so that the maximum expected loss remains within an acceptable threshold relative to your total portfolio. If the stop loss is triggered, the loss from AMD should not disrupt the broader portfolio\u2019s stability.  \n\u2003\u2022 Periodic rebalancing: Regularly review your allocation and adjust your position size in response to changes in market conditions, technical signals, or if the overall risk profile of AMD changes relative to your other investments.\n\nBy following these conservative strategies, you\u2019ll be positioned to capture potential upside\u2014if AMD continues its growth trajectory\u2014while effectively safeguarding against significant losses. This balanced, risk-aware approach is key to preserving capital in volatile market conditions while still participating in strategic growth opportunities.",
      "history": "Risky Analyst: From an aggressive risk analyst perspective, here's why this AMD play is worth a go:\n\n1. High-Reward Opportunities & Growth Potential:\n\u2003\u2022 AMD is in the midst of a strategic growth narrative. The company\u2019s strong market presence, bolstered by robust social media sentiment (with stellar bullish signals on Reddit and StockTwits), suggests that there's a huge re-pricing opportunity waiting to be unlocked.\n\u2003\u2022 The potential for breakthrough earnings and favorable industry catalysts (like increased semiconductor demand and innovative tech developments) provide an enticing upside. A phased entry at technical support zones (around the SMA 20 at $169\u2013$170) sets the stage to capture significant upside if the momentum carries forward.\n\u2003\u2022 Technicals indicate a bullish trend overall, and if the stock successfully holds above key support levels, the reactivity among traders could lead to rapid, high-reward upward moves.\n\n2. Why the Risks Are Worth Taking:\n\u2003\u2022 While the valuation metrics (a high P/E and elevated EV/FCF) hint at lofty expectations, they also signal that there is room for a market \"reset\" if the growth catalysts materialize. The current environment is ripe for mispriced growth to be corrected, potentially driving dramatic gains.\n\u2003\u2022 Despite bearish indicators like the MACD, the aggressive sentiment on social platforms suggests that investor enthusiasm could overwhelm technical concerns, leading to an explosive upward move.\n\u2003\u2022 By deploying a controlled, aggressive trade (allocating 5%\u20137% of your portfolio), you can capitalize on the high growth potential without overexposing your portfolio to a single stock.\n\n3. Potential Upside Scenarios:\n\u2003\u2022 Earnings surprises: A better-than-expected earnings report or positive guidance can serve as a catalyst\u2014possibly triggering a rapid move as investors reprice the stock.\n\u2003\u2022 Technical reversal: If price action rebounds from the identified support levels (around $169\u2013$170), it could spark a strong bullish trend supported by renewed momentum and easing technical concerns such as the MACD divergence.\n\u2003\u2022 Catalyst events: Future semiconductor trends, breakthroughs, or favorable supply chain news can ignite fresh investor interest, further fueling the stock\u2019s run higher. This aligns with the strong social sentiment showing that the market is ready to reward AMD\u2019s growth story.\n\n4. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Aggressive Positions:\n\u2003\u2022 Staggered Entry: Instead of a lump-sum purchase, use a phased buying strategy to average your cost around key technical support zones. This approach optimizes entry points during pullbacks and minimizes exposure to short-term volatility.\n\u2003\u2022 Stop Loss Orders: To curb potential drawdowns, set a stop loss roughly 7%\u201310% below your average entry price. This will ensure that your downside risk remains capped if the trade doesn\u2019t move in your favor.\n\u2003\u2022 Hedging with Options: As an extra layer of protection, consider using out-of-the-money (OTM) put options or put spreads. This provides a safety net if the stock experiences a swift, turbulent drop, enabling you to limit losses while staying positioned for upside.\n\u2003\u2022 Continuous Monitoring: Regularly track key technical indicators (like SMA support and MACD trends) and fundamental catalysts (earnings releases, supply chain updates, etc.). This ensures that you can exit or adjust your position rapidly if market conditions shift.\n\u2003\nIn summary, while the aggressive nature of this trade inherently carries risks\u2014chiefly related to elevated valuations and short-term technical warnings\u2014the potential for high-growth, catalyst-driven upside makes it a compelling opportunity. By employing a staggered entry strategy, tight stop losses, and hedging with options, you can actively manage the risks while positioning yourself to capture substantial gains. This balanced yet aggressive approach is designed to exploit the high-reward potential while keeping downside exposure in check.\n\nSafe Analyst: Below is a conservative risk perspective on the proposed AMD investment, with a strong focus on capital preservation and strategies to mitigate potential losses:\n\n1.

Any disappointment in earnings or future growth may result in a sudden re-rating, causing significant drawdowns.  \n\u2003\u2022 Market volatility and sentiment shifts: Rapid changes in social sentiment or unexpected market-wide corrections could lead to sharp short-term volatility, which might exacerbate losses before technical recovery is observed.  \n\u2003\u2022 Macro factors or negative news: Unforeseen shifts in industry trends, supply chain issues, or regulatory changes affecting semiconductors can lead to broader market sentiment turning bearish.\n\n3. Risk Mitigation and Hedging Strategies  \n\u2003\u2022 Stop loss orders: Enforce strict stop loss levels (7%\u201310% below your average entry price) to automatically cap losses if the market moves against your position.  \n\u2003\u2022 Hedging with options: Consider purchasing out-of-the-money (OTM) put options or establishing a put spread. This \u201cbelt-and-suspenders\u201d approach can provide insurance against sharp downturns while allowing you to benefit from any upward movement.  \n\u2003\u2022 Active monitoring and readiness to adjust: Keep a close eye on technical indicators such as the MACD, RSI, and moving averages. If these signals confirm growing bearishness, be prepared to reduce your position or exit to protect capital.  \n\u2003\u2022 Diversification: Maintain a diversified portfolio so that any negative performance in AMD will not overly impact your overall portfolio performance.\n\n4. Safe Position Sizing Recommendations  \n\u2003\u2022 Keep the allocation limited: Invest only 5%\u20137% of your portfolio in AMD to ensure that potential losses remain a small fraction of your total capital.  \n\u2003\u2022 Use proportional risk management: Align your stop loss size and hedging strategy so that the maximum expected loss remains within an acceptable threshold relative to your total portfolio. If the stop loss is triggered, the loss from AMD should not disrupt the broader portfolio\u2019s stability.  \n\u2003\u2022 Periodic rebalancing: Regularly review your allocation and adjust your position size in response to changes in market conditions, technical signals, or if the overall risk profile of AMD changes relative to your other investments.\n\nBy following these conservative strategies, you\u2019ll be positioned to capture potential upside\u2014if AMD continues its growth trajectory\u2014while effectively safeguarding against significant losses. This balanced, risk-aware approach is key to preserving capital in volatile market conditions while still participating in strategic growth opportunities.\n\nNeutral Analyst: Below is a balanced, data-based risk perspective that integrates both the technical and fundamental signals, social sentiment, and news coverage:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n1.

This moderate stake sizes your exposure to capitalize on growth drivers, while limiting potential drawdowns in the event of a technical breakdown.  \n\n\u2022 Hedging and Diversification:  \n\u2003\u2013 Consider using hedged overlays (e.g., protective OTM put options or put spreads) to mitigate sharp movements in case technical levels such as the SMA20 ($169\u2013$170 range) fail to hold.  \n\u2003\u2013 This approach balances the aggressive upside with a clear stick to risk management.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3.

A balanced approach\u2014employing moderate position sizing, a staggered entry strategy, and proactive risk management\u2014is key to capitalizing on potential gains while protecting against downside risks.",
      "current_risky_response": "From an aggressive risk analyst perspective, here's why this AMD play is worth a go:\n\n1. High-Reward Opportunities & Growth Potential:\n\u2003\u2022 AMD is in the midst of a strategic growth narrative. The company\u2019s strong market presence, bolstered by robust social media sentiment (with stellar bullish signals on Reddit and StockTwits), suggests that there's a huge re-pricing opportunity waiting to be unlocked.\n\u2003\u2022 The potential for breakthrough earnings and favorable industry catalysts (like increased semiconductor demand and innovative tech developments) provide an enticing upside. A phased entry at technical support zones (around the SMA 20 at $169\u2013$170) sets the stage to capture significant upside if the momentum carries forward.\n\u2003\u2022 Technicals indicate a bullish trend overall, and if the stock successfully holds above key support levels, the reactivity among traders could lead to rapid, high-reward upward moves.\n\n2. Why the Risks Are Worth Taking:\n\u2003\u2022 While the valuation metrics (a high P/E and elevated EV/FCF) hint at lofty expectations, they also signal that there is room for a market \"reset\" if the growth catalysts materialize. The current environment is ripe for mispriced growth to be corrected, potentially driving dramatic gains.\n\u2003\u2022 Despite bearish indicators like the MACD, the aggressive sentiment on social platforms suggests that investor enthusiasm could overwhelm technical concerns, leading to an explosive upward move.\n\u2003\u2022 By deploying a controlled, aggressive trade (allocating 5%\u20137% of your portfolio), you can capitalize on the high growth potential without overexposing your portfolio to a single stock.\n\n3. Potential Upside Scenarios:\n\u2003\u2022 Earnings surprises: A better-than-expected earnings report or positive guidance can serve as a catalyst\u2014possibly triggering a rapid move as investors reprice the stock.\n\u2003\u2022 Technical reversal: If price action rebounds from the identified support levels (around $169\u2013$170), it could spark a strong bullish trend supported by renewed momentum and easing technical concerns such as the MACD divergence.\n\u2003\u2022 Catalyst events: Future semiconductor trends, breakthroughs, or favorable supply chain news can ignite fresh investor interest, further fueling the stock\u2019s run higher. This aligns with the strong social sentiment showing that the market is ready to reward AMD\u2019s growth story.\n\n4. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Aggressive Positions:\n\u2003\u2022 Staggered Entry: Instead of a lump-sum purchase, use a phased buying strategy to average your cost around key technical support zones. This approach optimizes entry points during pullbacks and minimizes exposure to short-term volatility.\n\u2003\u2022 Stop Loss Orders: To curb potential drawdowns, set a stop loss roughly 7%\u201310% below your average entry price. This will ensure that your downside risk remains capped if the trade doesn\u2019t move in your favor.\n\u2003\u2022 Hedging with Options: As an extra layer of protection, consider using out-of-the-money (OTM) put options or put spreads. This provides a safety net if the stock experiences a swift, turbulent drop, enabling you to limit losses while staying positioned for upside.\n\u2003\u2022 Continuous Monitoring: Regularly track key technical indicators (like SMA support and MACD trends) and fundamental catalysts (earnings releases, supply chain updates, etc.). This ensures that you can exit or adjust your position rapidly if market conditions shift.\n\u2003\nIn summary, while the aggressive nature of this trade inherently carries risks\u2014chiefly related to elevated valuations and short-term technical warnings\u2014the potential for high-growth, catalyst-driven upside makes it a compelling opportunity. By employing a staggered entry strategy, tight stop losses, and hedging with options, you can actively manage the risks while positioning yourself to capture substantial gains. This balanced yet aggressive approach is designed to exploit the high-reward potential while keeping downside exposure in check.",

For example, if the weighted average entry comes near $170, set the stop loss at roughly $158.\n\u2022 HEDGING: Evaluate purchasing OTM put options (or establish a put spread) concurrently for additional downside protection if technical indicators (e.g., MACD) signal momentum shifts.\n\u2022 PRE-TRADE CHECKS: Verify position limits, ensure the order sizes align with daily volume profiles, and confirm market conditions (tight bid/ask spreads, sufficient depth).\n\u2022 SLIPPAGE & ABORT: Maximum slippage tolerance is set at 1% for any execution. If market volatility expands beyond acceptable thresholds or liquidity recedes sharply during execution, abort outstanding orders and reassess.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n4.
