# Performance Optimization Verification Checklist

## Pre-Implementation Baseline
- [ ] Record current runtime: 215s
- [ ] Record current token usage: 41,097
- [ ] Save trace ID for comparison: 1f06e917-c4bb-6c0c-a525-55b23f626500

## Phase 1: Async Token Operations
### Implementation
- [ ] Create `count_tokens_async()` method
- [ ] Add `await asyncio.to_thread()` for CPU operations
- [ ] Update all callers to use async version
- [ ] Maintain sync fallback for compatibility

### Verification with debug_local.sh
```bash
# Test async token counting
./debug_local.sh --test-specific "async_tokens"

# Expected output:
# ✅ Async token operations working
# ✅ No blocking detected
# ✅ Performance improvement: >20%
```

## Phase 2: Global Tokenizer Cache
### Implementation
- [ ] Create `tokenizer_cache.py` with singleton pattern
- [ ] Replace all `tiktoken.encoding_for_model()` calls
- [ ] Verify single instance across all agents
- [ ] Add cache statistics logging

### Verification with debug_local.sh
```bash
# Test tokenizer cache
./debug_local.sh --test-specific "tokenizer_cache"

# Expected output:
# ✅ Tokenizer cache singleton verified
# ✅ Cache hits: >90%
# ✅ Initialization count: 1
```

## Phase 3: Parallel Prompt Processing
### Implementation
- [ ] Create `batch_optimizer.py`
- [ ] Implement `process_prompts_parallel()`
- [ ] Update graph setup to batch prompts
- [ ] Add timing metrics

### Verification with debug_local.sh
```bash
# Test parallel processing
./debug_local.sh --test-specific "parallel_prompts"

# Expected output:
# ✅ Parallel processing enabled
# ✅ Processing time reduced by >40%
# ✅ All prompts processed correctly
```

## Phase 4: Performance Monitoring
### Implementation
- [ ] Create `performance_monitor.py`
- [ ] Add `@performance_monitor` decorator
- [ ] Apply to all critical operations
- [ ] Generate performance report

### Verification with debug_local.sh
```bash
# Generate performance report
./debug_local.sh --performance-report

# Expected output:
# ⏱️ Token Operations: <0.1s avg
# ⏱️ Prompt Processing: <0.5s avg
# ⏱️ Total Runtime: <140s
```

## Phase 5: Quick Wins
### Implementation
- [ ] Change `logger.info` → `logger.debug`
- [ ] Add `@lru_cache` to token counting
- [ ] Remove redundant operations
- [ ] Optimize hot paths

### Verification with debug_local.sh
```bash
# Test with reduced logging
./debug_local.sh --log-level ERROR

# Expected output:
# ✅ Minimal console output
# ✅ Runtime improvement: >10%
# ✅ Cache hit rate: >80%
```

## Full System Verification

### Step 1: Clean Environment Test
```bash
# Clean run with all optimizations
rm -rf debug_logs/*
./debug_local.sh --full-test

# Expected results:
# ✅ All phases pass
# ✅ No import errors
# ✅ Studio compatibility: PASS
```

### Step 2: Performance Comparison
```bash
# Run trace analysis comparison
./scripts/analyze_trace_production.sh --compare-performance

# Expected improvements:
# Runtime: 215s → <140s (>35% improvement)
# Tokens: Maintained at ~41,000
# Quality: A+ grade maintained
```

### Step 3: Load Testing
```bash
# Run multiple iterations
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Run $i:"
    time ./debug_local.sh --quick-test
done

# Expected:
# Consistent runtime <140s
# No memory leaks
# Stable performance
```

### Step 4: Memory Profiling
```bash
# Check memory usage
./debug_local.sh --profile-memory

# Expected:
# Memory usage stable
# No significant increase from caching
# Garbage collection working
```

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Runtime: <140s (target: 35% reduction from 215s)
- [ ] Token usage: <42,000 (maintain current 41,097)
- [ ] Success rate: 100% (maintain)
- [ ] Quality grade: A+ (maintain)

### Technical Verification
- [ ] All async operations non-blocking
- [ ] Single tokenizer instance verified
- [ ] Parallel processing working
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Cache hit rates >80%

### Integration Testing
- [ ] debug_local.sh full pass
- [ ] LangSmith trace improved
- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] Memory usage acceptable
- [ ] CPU usage optimized

## Rollback Verification

If issues occur:
```bash
# Test rollback flags
./debug_local.sh --disable-async --disable-cache --disable-parallel

# Should still work with:
# ✅ Original functionality maintained
# ✅ Performance back to baseline
# ✅ No errors or failures
```

## Final Sign-off

- [ ] All checklist items completed
- [ ] Performance targets achieved
- [ ] No regressions identified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for production
