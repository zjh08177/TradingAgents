            "content": "### Comprehensive Analysis of AAPL Social Media Sentiment\n\n#### 1. Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",

Overall Sentiment Score\nTo calculate the overall sentiment score, we will weigh the scores based on the amount of data from each platform. Below are the scores:\n\n- **Reddit**: Sentiment Score = 0.982 (29 posts)\n- **Twitter**: Sentiment Score = 0.74 (2 mentions)\n- **StockTwits**: Sentiment Score = 0.538 (30 messages)\n\nGiven the above data, we can calculate a weighted average sentiment score. Since Reddit has a significantly higher volume of data with a strong sentiment score, we'll give it more weight.\n\nWeighted Calculation:\n- Reddit contributes: **0.982 * 29 = 28.478**\n- Twitter contributes: **0.74 * 2 = 1.48**\n- StockTwits contributes: **0.538 * 30 = 16.14**\n\nTotal Sentiment Contribution: \n- **Total = 28.478 + 1.48 + 16.14 = 46.098**\n- **Total Counts = 29 + 2 + 30 = 61**\n\nOverall Sentiment Score = **46.098 / 61 = 0.756** (rounded to three decimal points)\n\n**Overall Sentiment Score = 0.756**\n\n#### 2. Confidence Level\nBased on the analysis, Reddit and StockTwits have a high confidence level due to the volume of posts, while Twitter has only two mentions leading to a medium confidence. For the overall confidence level, we can say it adjusts to **Medium** because of the minimal Twitter data.\n\n**Confidence Level = Medium**\n\n#### 3. Sentiment Trend\nSince Reddit shows a very high sentiment score and StockTwits shows a bullish sentiment while Twitter indicates a bullish sentiment overall, the sentiment appears stable, driven primarily by Reddit.\n\n**Sentiment Trend = Stable**\n\n#### 4. Top 3 Key Insights\n1. **Reddit Dominance**: Reddit has the highest sentiment score (0.982), indicating strong positive sentiment and engagement concerning AAPL, with 29 posts analyzed providing robust data.\n2. **Limited Data from Twitter**: Only 2 mentions were recorded on Twitter, which may not provide a representative sentiment view from this platform and could skew the overall analysis.\n3. **Mixed Results on StockTwits**: Although the overall sentiment is bullish, the sentiment score (0.538) is much lower compared to Reddit, with only 33.3% of messages being bullish.\n\n#### 5. Trading Signal\nConsidering the overall positive sentiment, particularly from Reddit, and the stable trend observed across platforms (especially in the high sentiment area), the recommendation is to:\n\n**Trading Signal = BUY**\n\n**Rationale**: The strong positive sentiment from Reddit (with high confidence) and the general bullish sentiment on both StockTwits and Twitter indicate positive market sentiment surrounding AAPL, suggesting potential upward movement in stock price. The minimal bearish sentiment across platforms further supports a buy signal. \n\n### Note:\n- Twitter data was limited, affecting overall confidence in that platform's perspective.\n- Continuous monitoring of social media trends is recommended for timely adjustments based on sentiment changes.",
