## Integration Guide

### Enabling Phase 1 Optimizations
```python
# In your configuration
config = {
    'enable_phase1_optimizations': True,
    'enable_async_tokens': True,
    'enable_ultra_prompts': True,
    'enable_parallel_execution': True,
    'max_parallel_agents': 4
}

# Create optimized graph
from src.agent.graph.optimized_setup import OptimizedGraphBuilder
builder = OptimizedGraphBuilder(quick_llm, deep_llm, config)
graph = builder.setup_graph()
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Simple component tests
python3 scripts/test_phase1_simple.py

# Full integration tests (requires proper imports)
python3 scripts/test_phase1_integration.py

# Debug script with all validations
bash scripts/debug_phase1_local.sh
```
